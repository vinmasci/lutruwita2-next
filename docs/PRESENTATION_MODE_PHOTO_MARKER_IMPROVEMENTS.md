# Presentation Mode Photo Marker Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines improvements made to the photo marker highlighting system in presentation mode. The key issue addressed was that all photo markers were being highlighted in presentation mode, when only the active/selected photo marker should be highlighted.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Photo Marker Highlighting**: In presentation mode, all photo markers were highlighted with an orange glow effect, making it difficult to identify which photo was currently selected.
2. **3D Pitch Transition**: When selecting a photo, the 3D pitch transition was not working correctly, resulting in an abrupt or non-existent pitch change.

## Implementation Details

### Photo Marker Highlighting

We modified the marker components to properly handle the presentation mode context:

1. Added an `isPresentationMode` flag to both `PhotoMarker` and `SimplifiedPhotoMarker` components
2. Updated the CSS to ensure only the selected photo is highlighted in presentation mode
3. Added specific CSS classes for presentation mode markers to control their appearance

#### Key CSS Changes

```css
/* In presentation mode, non-highlighted markers should have no highlight effect */
.presentation-photo-layer .photo-marker-bubble:not(.highlighted),
.photo-marker-bubble.presentation-mode:not(.highlighted) {
  transform: none !important;
  border: 2px solid white !important;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3) !important;
  animation: none !important;
}

/* Presentation mode highlighted marker point */
.presentation-photo-layer .photo-marker-container.highlighted .photo-marker-point,
.simplified-photo-marker-container.highlighted.presentation-mode .photo-marker-point {
  border-top-color: #FF9500 !important; /* Orange point */
  filter: drop-shadow(0 0 5px rgba(255, 149, 0, 0.7)) !important;
}
```

### 3D Pitch Effect

The 3D pitch effect when viewing photos in presentation mode was improved by:

1. First using `map.setPitch()` to immediately set the pitch to the desired value (90 degrees on desktop, 0 on mobile)
2. Then using `map.easeTo()` with a duration to create a smooth transition effect
3. Adding a small delay between these operations to ensure they work correctly

#### Key Code Changes

```javascript
// Set the pitch only once when the modal first opens
if (!pitchSetRef.current) {
  const isMobile = isMobileDevice();
  
  // First set the pitch directly to ensure it changes
  map.setPitch(isMobile ? 0 : 90);
  
  // Then use easeTo for a smoother transition
  setTimeout(() => {
    map.easeTo({
      pitch: isMobile ? 0 : 90,
      duration: 800 // Longer duration for a smoother transition
    });
  }, 100);
  
  // Mark that we've set the pitch
  pitchSetRef.current = true;
}
```

## Technical Details

### Pitch Setting Sequence

The pitch setting process follows this sequence:

1. When the photo modal first opens, we check if the pitch has already been set (using `pitchSetRef`)
2. If not set yet, we immediately set the pitch using `map.setPitch()`
3. After a short delay (100ms), we use `map.easeTo()` to create a smooth transition
4. We set `pitchSetRef.current = true` to ensure this only happens once
5. When the modal closes, we reset the pitch back to 0 with a smooth transition

### Marker Highlighting Logic

The marker highlighting logic works as follows:

1. In the `PresentationPhotoLayer.js` file, we pass an `isPresentationMode: true` flag to all photo markers
2. In the marker components, we check for this flag and apply special styling rules
3. Only markers with both `isPresentationMode` and `isHighlighted` get the orange highlight effect
4. All other markers in presentation mode get a standard white styling

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Users can now clearly identify which photo is currently selected in presentation mode
2. **Smoother 3D Transitions**: The 3D pitch effect now transitions smoothly when viewing photos
3. **Consistent Styling**: Marker styling is now consistent across different view modes
