# Lutruwita Native Mobile App Implementation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Lutruwita Native Mobile App implementation plan. The mobile app is designed to complement the existing web application by providing a native mobile experience for viewing and using maps that have already been created in the web app.

The documentation has been split into multiple files for better organization and readability.

## Current Implementation Status

The mobile app implementation has made significant progress with the following features:

- **Project Initialization**: Created mobile directory, initialized React Native with Expo, and set up TypeScript configuration
- **Navigation**: Implemented tab-based navigation with React Navigation, including a dedicated Saved Routes tab
- **UI Screens**: Created versions of Home, Saved Routes, Map, Downloads, and Profile screens
- **Theming System**: Implemented a comprehensive theming system with light/dark mode support
- **UI Components**: Integrated React Native Paper for consistent, themed UI components
- **Mock Data**: Added mock data for routes, maps, and user profiles for development
- **Map Integration**: Implemented WebView-based Mapbox GL JS integration for displaying maps and routes
- **Route Display**: Added ability to display routes from the web app on the mobile map
- **Enhanced Map Experience**: Redesigned the map screen with animated info panels and controls
- **Route Filtering**: Implemented filtering by map type, location, distance, and surface type
- **Saved Routes**: Added dedicated screen for viewing and managing saved routes

See the [Implementation Checklist](./MOBILE_APP_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md) for a detailed breakdown of completed and pending tasks.

## Technology Stack

The mobile app is being built using:

- **Framework:** React Native with Expo
- **UI Components:** React Native Paper
- **Maps:** Mapbox GL JS in WebView (temporary), Mapbox GL Native (planned for production)
- **State Management:** React Context API
- **Theming:** Custom theme context with React Native Paper integration
- **Database:** Realm or SQLite (planned)
- **Authentication:** Auth0 (planned, integrated with web app)
- **Payments:** React Native IAP + Stripe (planned)
- **API Integration:** REST API to connect with the web app backend

## Theming System

The app includes a comprehensive theming system with the following features:

- **Light/Dark Mode**: Automatic system detection with manual override
- **Persistent Preferences**: Theme preferences saved to device storage
- **Consistent Typography**: Standardized text styles across the app
- **Color Palette**: Carefully designed color scheme with light/dark variants
- **Component Theming**: All UI components automatically adapt to the current theme
- **Theme Toggle**: User-accessible toggle in the Profile screen
