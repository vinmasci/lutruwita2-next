# Mobile App: Google Places POI Details Integration Status

**Objective:** Integrate Google Places information into the Point of Interest (POI) details drawer in the mobile app. The goal is to fetch and display details like address, rating, phone number, website, and opening hours using the `googlePlaceId` stored in the Cloudinary route data, similar to the web application's functionality.

**Progress:**

1.  **Type Definition Updated:** The `POI` interface in `mobile/lutruwita-mobile/src/services/routeService.ts` was updated to include an optional `googlePlaces` field, which can hold the `placeId` and the original `url` (though the URL is not used for this implementation).
2.  **Google Places Service Created:** A new service file, `mobile/lutruwita-mobile/src/services/googlePlacesService.ts`, was created. This service includes the `fetchPlaceDetails` function responsible for calling the Google Places API (Place Details endpoint) using a `placeId` and an API key to retrieve relevant place information.
3.  **API Key Configuration:** The necessary Google Places API key (`VITE_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` from the root `.env`) was added to the mobile app's environment file (`mobile/lutruwita-mobile/.env`) as `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY`.
4.  **POI Drawer Component Modified:** The `mobile/lutruwita-mobile/src/components/map/POIDetailsDrawer.tsx` component was updated to:
    *   Import the `fetchPlaceDetails` service and necessary React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).
    *   Include state variables (`googlePlacesDetails`, `isLoadingDetails`, `detailsError`) to manage the fetched data and loading/error states.
    *   Implement a `useEffect` hook that triggers `fetchPlaceDetails` when a POI with a `googlePlaceId` is selected.
    *   Add UI elements (using `lucide-react-native` icons and standard Text components) within the drawer to display the fetched details (rating, address, phone, website, opening hours) conditionally.
    *   Include basic loading (`ActivityIndicator`) and error (`Text`) indicators.

**Current Status:**

*   The core logic for fetching and displaying Google Places details is implemented in `POIDetailsDrawer.tsx` and `googlePlacesService.ts`.
*   **Update:** The TypeScript errors in `POIDetailsDrawer.tsx` have been resolved. The `useEffect` hook was refactored for safety, and style definitions were corrected.
*   **New Feature:** Added a horizontal photo slider to the `POIDetailsDrawer.tsx` component. This slider displays up to the first 5 photos fetched from the Google Places API for the selected POI. The `googlePlacesService.ts` was updated to request photo references and includes a helper function to construct photo URLs.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Testing:** Test the implementation thoroughly in the mobile app:
    *   Verify that Google Places details (rating, address, phone, website, opening hours) are fetched and displayed correctly.
    *   Verify that the photo slider appears for POIs with Google Places photos and displays the images correctly. Check the behavior for POIs with fewer than 5 photos or no photos.
    *   Ensure loading and error states function as expected for both details and photos.
