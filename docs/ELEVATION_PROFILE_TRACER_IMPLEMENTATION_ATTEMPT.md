# Elevation Profile Tracer Implementation Attempt

## Overview

This document summarizes the attempted implementation of the elevation profile tracer feature in presentation mode. The goal was to implement a feature that shows a marker on the elevation profile that corresponds to the current hover position on the map, as described in `docs/ELEVATION_PROFILE_TRACER.md`.

## Changes Made

The following changes were made to implement the elevation profile tracer in presentation mode:

1. Added console.log statements to the PresentationMapView.tsx file to debug the hover coordinates being passed to the MapContext.

2. Updated the marker styling in the PresentationElevationProfile.tsx file to match the styling in ElevationProfile.tsx:
   - Added a vertical dashed line from the bottom of the chart to the current point
   - Changed the circle radius from 6px to 4px
   - Reduced the stroke width from 2px to 1.5px
   - Moved the elevation text closer to the marker (12px vs 15px)
   - Added paintOrder="stroke" to improve text visibility
   - Adjusted font size from 12px to 10px

## Results

**IMPORTANT: The user has seen absolutely no effect from the changes made.**

Despite the code changes being successfully applied, the elevation profile tracer functionality is not working in presentation mode. The user reports seeing no visual changes or functionality improvements after the implementation.

## Possible Issues

Several potential issues could be causing the lack of visible results:

1. **Hover Coordinates Not Being Set**: The PresentationMapView component might not be correctly setting the hover coordinates in the MapContext.

2. **MapContext Provider Issue**: The MapContext provider might not be properly set up in the presentation mode component hierarchy.

3. **Component Rendering**: The PresentationElevationProfile component might not be re-rendering when hover coordinates change.

4. **Data Processing**: There might be issues with how the hover coordinates are processed to find the corresponding point on the elevation profile.

5. **CSS/Styling Issues**: The marker might be rendered but hidden due to CSS or styling issues.

## Next Steps

To resolve this issue, further investigation is needed:

1. Add more comprehensive logging throughout the component chain to track the flow of hover coordinates.

2. Verify that the MapContext is properly set up and accessible in presentation mode.

3. Check if the currentProfilePoint state is being updated correctly in the PresentationElevationProfile component.

4. Inspect the DOM during runtime to see if the marker elements are being rendered but not displayed.

5. Consider implementing a more direct approach to passing hover coordinates between components if the context-based approach is failing.
