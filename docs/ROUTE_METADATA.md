# Route Metadata Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of route metadata in the application, including what has been completed and what remains to be done.

## Current Implementation

### 1. Metadata Storage in MongoDB

The route metadata is now stored in MongoDB as part of the Route schema:

```javascript
// Route metadata for filtering
metadata: {
  country: { type: String },
  state: { type: String },
  lga: { type: String },
  totalDistance: { type: Number },
  totalAscent: { type: Number },
  unpavedPercentage: { type: Number },
  isLoop: { type: Boolean },
  publicId: { type: String }
}
```

### 2. Metadata Generation in GPX Uploader

The GPX uploader component now calculates and saves metadata when a route is created:

- **Location Data**: Country, state, and LGA (Local Government Area) are determined using the Nominatim API with a fallback to local calculations for Tasmania.
- **Distance and Elevation**: Total distance and ascent are calculated from route coordinates and elevation data.
- **Surface Type**: Unpaved percentage is calculated from surface data.
- **Loop Detection**: The system determines if a route is a loop by comparing start and end points.

### 3. API Response

The API now includes metadata in the response for both individual routes and route listings:

```javascript
return {
  id: routeData.id,
  persistentId: routeData.persistentId,
  name: routeData.name,
  // ... other fields
  metadata: routeData.metadata || {}, // Include metadata for filtering
  createdBy: createdBy
};
```

### 4. Client-Side Filtering

The LandingPage component has been updated to use metadata for filtering:

- **State/Region Filters**: Extracts unique states and regions from route metadata.
- **Surface Type Filter**: Uses metadata.unpavedPercentage with a fallback to calculation.
- **Distance Filter**: Uses metadata.totalDistance with a fallback to calculation.
- **Loop/Point-to-Point Filter**: Uses metadata.isLoop with a fallback to calculation.

## Recent Fixes

We identified and fixed several issues with the metadata implementation:

1. **API Response Handling**: Fixed the `publicRouteService.listRoutes()` function to properly handle the API response structure.

2. **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to track metadata through the system:
   - In the API to verify metadata is included in the response
   - In the service layer to verify metadata is received from the API
   - In the LandingPage component to verify metadata is available for filtering

3. **Fallback Calculations**: Ensured that all filters have fallbacks for routes without metadata.

## What's Left To Do

1. **Migration Script**: Create a script to add metadata to existing routes in the database.

2. **Enhanced Filtering UI**: Improve the filter UI to better showcase the available metadata filters.

3. **Metadata Editing**: Add the ability for users to manually edit metadata for routes where automatic detection is inaccurate.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching for frequently accessed metadata to improve filter performance.

5. **Search Functionality**: Enhance the search functionality to include metadata fields.

## Testing

To test the metadata implementation:

1. Create a new route with the GPX uploader
2. Verify that metadata is displayed in the UI
3. Save the route
4. Go to the landing page and verify that the route appears in the appropriate filters
5. Test each filter to ensure it works correctly with the metadata

## Conclusion

The route metadata implementation provides a solid foundation for filtering and searching routes. With the recent fixes, the system now correctly handles metadata from the database to the UI. The remaining tasks focus on improving the user experience and ensuring all routes have metadata.
