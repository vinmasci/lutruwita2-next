## Current Status
The elevation profile implementation is complete with all core functionality working:
1. Panel correctly positioned below sidebar (56px offset)
2. Full route distance displayed in chart
3. Statistics showing:
   - Total distance in kilometers
   - Total elevation gain in meters
   - Total elevation loss in meters
4. Proper font sizes and spacing for all elements
5. Clean, minimalist design without collapse functionality

## Recent Changes
1. Removed collapse/expand functionality for cleaner UI
2. Combined title and statistics into single header line
3. Updated all text to use Roboto font family
4. Optimized chart margins:
   - Reduced gap between y-axis label and chart
   - Increased bottom margin for x-axis visibility
   - Adjusted label positions for better alignment
5. Fine-tuned component height and spacing
6. Streamlined header layout with right-aligned statistics

## Overview
The elevation profile component displays elevation data from GPX files in a sticky panel at the bottom of the screen. It visualizes the route's elevation changes over distance using an area chart and provides key statistics about the route.

## Current Implementation
The existing `ElevationProfile` component:
- Uses recharts for visualization
- Displays elevation data as an area chart
- Shows distance (km) on X-axis and elevation (m) on Y-axis
- Includes tooltips for precise measurements
- Handles loading states and errors
- Processes elevation data from GPX file properties
- Shows route statistics in header
- Uses Roboto font throughout

## Layout
- Position: Fixed to bottom of screen, offset by sidebar width
- Width: Full viewport width minus sidebar
- Height: 220px total with optimized internal spacing
- Z-index: Above map but below sidebar
- Background: Semi-transparent dark background
- Border: Subtle top border for visual separation
- Typography: Roboto font family with consistent sizing

## Future Enhancements

1. Interactive Features
- Hover line that syncs with map position
- Click to zoom to map location
- Highlight segments based on surface type
- Show markers for points of interest

2. Additional Data
- Show grade percentage
- Mark significant peaks and valleys
- Surface type indicators

3. User Preferences
- Adjustable panel height
- Unit toggles (metric/imperial)
- Color scheme customization
- Chart type options

## Technical Notes

### Performance
- Consider using canvas renderer for large datasets
- Implement data point reduction for smoother rendering
- Use memoization for expensive calculations
- Optimize re-renders with React.memo

### Accessibility
- Screen reader support for chart data
- High contrast mode support
- Focus management for interactive elements


interface ClimbSegment 
The log shows that our climb detection algorithm has found 4 significant climbs in the route:

First climb (4.5km - 6.9km):

Length: 2.4km
Elevation gain: 124m
Average gradient: 5.2%
Second climb (13.0km - 14.9km):

Second climb (13.0km - 14.9km):

Length: 1.9km
Elevation gain: 71m
Average gradient: 3.8%
Third climb (25.8km - 29.8km):

Third climb (25.8km - 29.8km):

Length: 3.9km
Elevation gain: 311m
Average gradient: 7.9%
Fourth climb (31.1km - 38.9km):

Fourth climb (31.1km - 38.9km):

Length: 7.7km
Elevation gain: 504m
Average gradient: 6.5%

The algorithm is working as intended, finding sustained climbs where the gradient stays above 3% for at least 1km. The most significant climbs are:

The third climb with the steepest gradient (7.9%)
The fourth climb with the longest distance (7.7km) and most elevation gain (504m)
