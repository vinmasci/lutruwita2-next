## Recommendations

1. **TypeScript Migration Strategy**
   - Keep JavaScript versions as they are currently in use
   - Consider removing unused TypeScript versions to avoid confusion
   - Plan a gradual migration to TypeScript if desired, but ensure proper testing
   - Keep TypeScript definition files (.d.ts) that provide type information for JavaScript modules

2. **File Organization**
   - Consider consolidating index files that only re-export components
   - Review and potentially merge similar utility files
   - Ensure consistent file naming conventions across the project

3. **Next Steps**
   - Remove unused TypeScript versions to reduce confusion
   - If TypeScript migration is desired, create a migration plan that:
     - Tests each component thoroughly after migration
     - Updates all imports to reference new versions
     - Maintains functionality throughout the process
   - Consider migrating one feature at a time rather than individual files
