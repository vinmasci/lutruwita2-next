# Photo Lightbox Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a new photo lightbox component to replace the previous PhotoPreviewModal. The new component provides a more modern and user-friendly interface for viewing photos, with improved navigation, error handling, and visual design.

## Changes Made

1. **Created a new SimpleLightbox component**:
   - Implemented a modern lightbox design with improved UI
   - Added support for keyboard navigation (arrow keys and escape)
   - Improved error handling for image loading failures
   - Enhanced the display of photo metadata
   - Added thumbnail navigation for multiple photos
   - Implemented smooth transitions and hover effects
   - Used more rounded corners for a modern look

2. **Updated file structure**:
   - Created `SimpleLightbox.jsx` with proper JSX extension
   - Updated `index.js` to export both the old and new components

3. **Integrated the new component**:
   - Updated `PhotoLayer.js` to use the new SimpleLightbox component
   - Updated `PresentationPhotoLayer.js` to use the new SimpleLightbox component

4. **Visual improvements**:
   - Increased border radius for a more modern look
   - Enhanced thumbnail navigation with rounded corners
   - Improved layout and spacing for better visual hierarchy

## Technical Details

### Component Structure

The SimpleLightbox component is structured as follows:

1. **Header**: Contains the photo name and a close button
2. **Main Content**: Displays the photo with navigation buttons when multiple photos are available
3. **Footer**: Shows photo metadata (location, altitude) and actions (delete button)
4. **Thumbnail Navigation**: Displays thumbnails of all photos in the set for quick navigation

### Key Features

- **Optimized Image Loading**: Uses the best available image size based on context
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Supports arrow keys for navigation and escape to close
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles image loading failures
- **Thumbnail Navigation**: Allows quick switching between photos
- **Metadata Display**: Shows location coordinates and altitude when available

### Implementation Notes

- The component uses Material-UI components for consistent styling
- Navigation between photos is handled with React's useState and useCallback hooks
- The component integrates with the PhotoContext for photo management operations
- Error states are properly managed to ensure a good user experience

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: The new lightbox provides a more intuitive and visually appealing way to view photos
2. **Better Performance**: The component is optimized to use the appropriate image sizes
3. **Enhanced Navigation**: Users can easily navigate between photos using keyboard shortcuts or thumbnails
4. **Consistent Design**: The lightbox follows modern design principles with rounded corners and clean layout
5. **Error Resilience**: Proper error handling ensures a good experience even when images fail to load

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements could include:

1. Adding zoom functionality for detailed photo viewing
2. Implementing swipe gestures for touch devices
3. Adding animation transitions between photos
4. Supporting fullscreen mode
5. Adding photo editing capabilities directly in the lightbox
