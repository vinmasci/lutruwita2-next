Surface Detection Migration Overview
What We're Doing
We're fixing the surface detection functionality in the GPX processing system. This involves detecting whether road segments are paved or unpaved as a GPX track is processed.

Why We're Doing It
The current implementation in src/features/gpx/services/surfaceService.ts is not correctly processing coordinates and assigning surface types. We need to match the functionality that was working in the old implementation.

Reference Implementation
We're using OLDFUNCTIONS.md as our reference, which contains the working implementation. The key function we're migrating is assignSurfacesViaNearest, which successfully:

Processes points one at a time
Uses a bounding box for querying nearby roads
Has robust error handling and retry logic
Uses turf.js for accurate distance calculations
Handles complex junctions with special logic

Key Files Involved
Source File (Current Implementation):

src/features/gpx/services/surfaceService.ts
This is the file we need to modify
Reference File:

OLDFUNCTIONS.md
Contains the working implementation we want to match
Supporting Files:

src/features/gpx/utils/roadUtils.ts (helper functions)
src/features/gpx/types/gpx.types.ts (type definitions)

Current Progress Update
We have successfully implemented several key improvements to match the old implementation:

1. Point Processing:
- ✓ Implemented point-by-point processing in assignSurfacesViaNearest
- ✓ Added progress tracking for each point
- ✓ Implemented immediate surface assignment during processing

2. Surface Detection:
- ✓ Implemented bounding box queries for nearby roads
- ✓ Added sophisticated road detection with junction handling
- ✓ Implemented surface type assignment based on road properties

3. Error Handling:
- ✓ Added robust retry logic for tile loading
- ✓ Implemented comprehensive error handling
- ✓ Added fallback mechanisms for missing data

4. Junction Handling:
- ✓ Implemented complex junction detection
- ✓ Added circular pattern search for difficult intersections
- ✓ Added prioritization of main roads at junctions

   - Focus on routes with known surface changes
   - Test complex junctions and areas with poor map data
   - Verify surface type continuity with new fallback mechanism

2. Add inline documentation (Phase 7.1)
   - Document the batch processing strategy
   - Explain the retry and fallback mechanisms

   - Add performance benchmarks with the new optimizations

Each phase should be completed and tested before moving to the next. We'll add detailed logging throughout to help with debugging and verification. After each major change, we'll test with a sample GPX file to ensure functionality remains correct.
