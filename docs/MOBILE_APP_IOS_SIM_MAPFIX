ðŸ“š Summary: Fixing Mapbox Map Load Issues on iOS Simulator

ðŸ§© Problem:
Mapbox map was failing to load only on the iOS Simulator.
Worked fine on real mobile device.
ðŸ”¥ Root Cause:
The iOS Simulator did not have a development build of the app installed after expo prebuild.
Also possible minor network or caching issues in the Simulator.
ðŸ›  Steps Taken to Fix It:

1. Identified that the code itself was fine.
Because the map loaded normally on the real phone.
Meaning the bug was Simulator-specific, not a real app bug.
2. Realized that after using npx expo prebuild, a new native development build must be installed.
expo start --ios alone is not enough after prebuild.
After prebuild, you're in development build mode (real compiled iOS app needed).
3. Correct Build Process:
# 1. Prebuild native code if needed
npx expo prebuild

# 2. Build and install the app onto Simulator
npx expo run:ios
âœ… npx expo run:ios compiles the app, installs it, and launches it properly.

âœ… Metro Bundler starts automatically afterward.

âœ… Mapbox map loads correctly once the app is installed properly!

ðŸ§¹ Optional Extra Cleaning (if needed):

If there are Simulator issues (broken network, stale cache):

# Reset all Simulators
xcrun simctl shutdown all
xcrun simctl erase all
open -a Simulator
(Use this only if problems persist.)

âœ¨ Key Lessons Learned:


Insight	Why it matters
If it works on real device but not Simulator, the code is fine.	Simulator-specific problem, not app bug.
After expo prebuild, you must expo run:ios.	Because now you're using a native dev build, not Expo Go.
Don't waste time wiping node_modules unless absolutely necessary.	Most Simulator issues are network/caching-related, not dependency bugs.
Resetting the Simulator can fix invisible networking problems.	Quick fix for broken tile loading or SSL errors.
âš¡ Quick Future Command Cheat Sheet:

cd mobile/lutruwita-mobile
npx expo prebuild
npx expo run:ios
(or just npx expo run:ios if you already prebuilt.)

ðŸŽ¯ Final Quick Takeaway:

âž” Simulator was missing a built app.
âž” Built and installed with npx expo run:ios.
âž” Maps now load perfectly.
