# POI Disappearance Analysis

## Issue Description
POIs are present in the initial state but disappear during the save process:
1. Initial state shows POIs: `[{id: "d0074017-0cd1-4e1b-af7b-4645d836823a", ...}, {id: "ae174436-d69d-46dc-bee8-dba994c5a527", ...}]`
2. During save, POIs are empty: `{draggable: [], places: []}`

## Possible Causes

### 1. Context Provider Issues
- **Multiple POIContext Providers**
  - Nested providers could create isolated state contexts
  - Inner provider might override outer provider's state
  - Components might be accessing different provider instances

- **Provider Mounting/Unmounting**
  - Provider could be unmounting during route transitions
  - State could be reset when provider remounts
  - Race conditions between provider initialization and data access

### 2. State Management Issues
- **Race Conditions**
  - Async operations might be clearing state before save
  - Multiple state updates might be conflicting
  - State updates might not be batched properly

- **State Reset Triggers**
  - Other operations might be triggering state resets
  - Cleanup effects might be clearing state
  - Component remounts might be resetting state

### 3. Component Lifecycle Issues
- **Cleanup Effects**
  - useEffect cleanup functions might be clearing state
  - Component unmounting might trigger state resets
  - Incorrect dependency arrays in useEffect

- **Component Remounting**
  - Key changes might cause full remounts
  - Route changes might unmount/remount components
  - Parent component updates might force child remounts

### 4. Data Flow Issues
- **State Synchronization**
  - POIContext and RouteContext might be out of sync
  - Local state might not be properly synced with context
  - Stale state references might be used

- **Data Transform Issues**
  - POI data might be incorrectly transformed during save
  - Type conversions might be dropping data
  - Filter operations might be too aggressive

### 5. Timing Issues
- **Save Process Timing**
  - Save might start before POI state is fully loaded
  - State updates might not be committed before save
  - Async operations might have incorrect ordering

- **Event Handler Timing**
  - Click handlers might execute before state updates
  - Event propagation might cause unexpected state changes
  - Debounce/throttle might affect state updates

### 6. Memory/Reference Issues
- **State References**
  - Stale closures might capture old state
  - Object references might not trigger updates
  - Shallow comparisons might miss updates

- **Memory Management**
  - Garbage collection might affect state
  - Memory leaks might cause state corruption
  - Large state objects might cause performance issues

### 7. Error Handling Issues
- **Silent Failures**
  - Error boundaries might swallow errors
  - Try/catch blocks might hide issues
  - Promise rejections might be unhandled

- **State Recovery**
  - Error states might not be properly handled
  - Recovery mechanisms might clear state
  - Fallback states might be incorrect

### 8. Initialization Issues
- **Load Order**
  - Dependencies might load in wrong order
  - Initial state might not be properly set
  - Default values might override actual data

- **Hydration**
  - Server/client hydration might mismatch
  - Initial state might not persist
  - Rehydration might override state

## Investigation Steps

1. **State Flow Analysis**
   - Add detailed logging at each state change
   - Track component mount/unmount cycles
   - Monitor effect execution order

2. **Component Hierarchy Check**
   - Verify provider nesting
   - Check component tree structure
   - Confirm context access patterns

3. **Timing Analysis**
   - Add timestamps to state changes
   - Track async operation order
   - Monitor event execution sequence

4. **Data Integrity Check**
   - Validate data at each transform step
   - Verify type consistency
   - Check reference handling

5. **Error Tracking**
   - Add error boundaries
   - Implement comprehensive error logging
   - Monitor rejected promises

## Potential Solutions

1. **State Management**
   - Implement state persistence
   - Add state validation
   - Use immutable state patterns

2. **Error Handling**
   - Add recovery mechanisms
   - Implement state rollback
   - Enhance error reporting

3. **Timing Control**
   - Add state locks
   - Implement operation queuing
   - Control async flow

4. **Data Flow**
   - Strengthen type safety
   - Add data validation
   - Implement state snapshots

5. **Component Lifecycle**
   - Control mount/unmount behavior
   - Implement state preservation
   - Add lifecycle hooks
