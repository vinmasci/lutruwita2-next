# Presentation Mode Performance Improvements

## Initial Problem
The presentation mode was loading significantly slower than creation mode due to redundant processing of route data.

## Analysis
We identified two key differences in how routes were processed:

### Creation Mode (Fast)
```typescript
// In MapView.tsx handleUploadGpx:
const gpxResult = await processGpx(file);  // Process GPX
const normalizedRoute = normalizeRoute(gpxResult);  // Normalize once
addRoute(normalizedRoute);  // Add directly to context
```

### Presentation Mode (Slow)
```typescript
// In RoutePresentation.tsx:
const routeData = await publicRouteService.loadRoute(id);  // Load from server
const result = processPublicRoute(route);  // Process first time
// Then in usePresentationRouteInit:
const normalizedRoute = normalizeRoute(route);  // Process second time
addRoute(normalizedRoute);  // Add to context
```

## Solution
We optimized the presentation mode by:

1. Removing redundant processing:
- Removed processPublicRoute step
- Removed unnecessary normalizeRoute step
- Server data is already in the correct format

2. Minimal Route Processing:
```typescript
// Just add required fields to server routes
return route.routes.map(routeData => ({
  ...routeData,
  _type: 'loaded' as const,
  _loadedState: route,
  id: routeData.routeId,
  isVisible: true,
  status: {
    processingState: 'completed' as const,
    progress: 100
  }
}));
```

3. Proper Context Usage:
- Using PhotoContext and POIContext directly
- Loading photos and POIs through their respective contexts
- No redundant state management

## Result
The presentation mode now:
1. Loads faster by avoiding double processing
2. Maintains all functionality (POIs, photos, etc.)
3. Uses proper TypeScript types
4. Follows a more efficient data flow

The key improvement is that we now trust and use the server data directly with minimal transformation, while still maintaining type safety and all required functionality.
