# Swift Route Details Implementation Progress

This document tracks the progress of implementing the route details functionality in the CyaTrails Swift app, based on the plan outlined in [SWIFT_ROUTE_DETAILS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](SWIFT_ROUTE_DETAILS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md).

**IMPORTANT NOTE: The Swift implementation must EXACTLY match the React Native implementation in every aspect, including visual appearance, interaction patterns, animations, and functionality. No deviations or "Swift-native" alternatives are acceptable unless they achieve the exact same look and feel as the React Native version.**

## Current Implementation Status (May 18, 2025)

After reviewing the screenshots and comparing them to our current implementation, it's clear that **we are still far from achieving the desired implementation**. The current Swift implementation does not match the React Native implementation in several critical areas:

### Major Discrepancies

1. **Elevation Drawer UI and Behavior**:
   - The current drawer implementation does not match the React Native version in appearance or behavior
   - The route tabs are not properly implemented with the correct styling and layout
   - The minimized view does not match the screenshot showing "Overview" with a right arrow and three key stats
   - The expanded view lacks the proper layout, styling, and content organization

2. **Route Selection and Navigation**:
   - The route tabs are not properly implemented to allow switching between routes
   - The visual indicators for the current route do not match the React Native implementation
   - The navigation between routes is not properly implemented

3. **Elevation Profile Visualization**:
   - The elevation chart does not match the React Native implementation in appearance or functionality
   - The gradient coloring and section visualization are missing or incorrect
   - The stats display does not match the React Native implementation

4. **Additional Content**:
   - The route description section is missing or incomplete
   - The weather forecast and historical weather sections are missing
   - The action buttons are not properly implemented

### Completed Work

1. **Basic Route Loading**:
   - Route data is successfully loaded from Firebase
   - Basic route information is displayed
   - Route polyline is displayed on the map

2. **Map Controls**:
   - Map style switching is implemented
   - 3D terrain mode is implemented
   - Basic map controls are in place

### Next Steps

Based on the screenshots provided and the current state of the implementation, the following priorities have been established:

1. **CRITICAL**: Completely redesign the ElevationDrawerView.swift to match the screenshots exactly
   - Implement the minimized view with "Overview" and right arrow as shown in the second screenshot
   - Implement the expanded view with tabs, stats, elevation profile, and route description as shown in the first screenshot
   - Ensure exact visual matching of all UI elements, spacing, typography, and colors

2. **CRITICAL**: Implement proper route selection and navigation
   - Ensure the tabs allow switching between routes
   - Implement proper visual indicators for the current route
   - Ensure the elevation profile updates correctly when switching routes

3. **HIGH**: Enhance the elevation profile visualization
   - Implement proper gradient coloring and section visualization
   - Ensure the elevation chart matches the React Native implementation exactly
   - Implement proper stats display with icons and layout

4. **MEDIUM**: Add route description and additional content
   - Implement the route description section
   - Add weather forecast and historical weather sections
   - Implement action buttons

5. **LOW**: Enhance photo viewer and POI details view
   - Update these components once the elevation drawer is properly implemented
   - Ensure they match the React Native implementation exactly

## Phase 1: Route Details Navigation (Completed)

**Status Update (May 18, 2025)**: Successfully implemented the navigation to the RouteDetailView page. The app now properly loads the RouteDetailView when a route is selected from either the RouteListDrawer or the RoutePreviewDrawer.

### Step 1: Create RouteDetailView.swift (Completed)

Created a basic RouteDetailView.swift file that displays route details:

```swift
// mobile/CyaTrails/CyaTrails/Views/RouteDetailView.swift

import SwiftUI
import MapboxMaps

struct RouteDetailView: View {
    // Route ID passed from the navigation
    let routeId: String
    
    // View model for route data
    @StateObject private var viewModel = RouteDetailViewModel()
    
    // State for tracking map camera position
    @State private var cameraPosition = CameraOptions(...)
    
    // Reference to the MapView
    @State private var mapView: MapView?
    
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            // Mapbox MapView
            MapViewRepresentable(...)
            
            // Loading indicator
            if viewModel.isLoading { ... }
            
            // Error message
            if let error = viewModel.errorMessage { ... }
            
            // Route info panel at the bottom
            VStack {
                Spacer()
                
                if let route = viewModel.route {
                    RouteInfoPanel(route: route)
                }
            }
        }
        .navigationTitle(viewModel.route?.name ?? "Route Details")
        .navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.inline)
        .onAppear {
            // Load route data when view appears
            viewModel.loadRoute(persistentId: routeId)
        }
    }
}
```

The view includes:
- A MapViewRepresentable to display the route on a map
- A loading indicator for when data is being fetched
- An error message display for when errors occur
- A route info panel to display basic route information
- Navigation title that shows the route name

### Step 2: Create RouteDetailViewModel.swift (Completed)

Created a view model to handle the data loading and processing for the RouteDetailView:

```swift
// mobile/CyaTrails/CyaTrails/ViewModels/RouteDetailViewModel.swift

import Foundation
import Combine
import MapboxMaps

class RouteDetailViewModel: ObservableObject {
    // Published properties for SwiftUI to observe
    @Published var route: Route?
    @Published var pois: [POI] = []
    @Published var lines: [Line] = []
    @Published var photos: [Photo] = []
    @Published var isLoading = false
    @Published var errorMessage: String?
    
    // Reference to the Firebase service
    private let firebaseService = FirebaseService.shared
    
    // Load route data from Firebase
    func loadRoute(persistentId: String) { ... }
    
    // Calculate the bounding box for a route
    func calculateBounds(from coordinates: [[Double]]) -> (...) { ... }
    
    // Get camera bounds for the route
    func getCameraBounds() -> CoordinateBounds? { ... }
}
```

The view model includes:
- Published properties for the route data, POIs, lines, photos, loading state, and error messages
- A method to load route data from Firebase
- Helper methods for calculating map bounds and camera positions

### Step 3: Update HomeView.swift for Navigation (Completed)

Updated the HomeView.swift file to navigate to the RouteDetailView when a route is selected:

```swift
// mobile/CyaTrails/CyaTrails/Views/HomeView.swift

struct HomeView: View {
    // Navigation state
    @State private var navigateToRouteDetail = false
    
    // State for selected route for detail view
    @State private var selectedRoute: RouteListItem? = nil
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            ZStack {
                // ... existing code ...
                
                // Route list drawer overlay
                if showingRouteListDrawer {
                    RouteListDrawer(
                        routes: viewModel.routes,
                        onSelectRoute: { route in
                            // Store the selected route for later use
                            selectedRoute = route
                            
                            // Close the drawer
                            showingRouteListDrawer = false
                            
                            // Navigate to route detail view
                            navigateToRouteDetail = true
                        },
                        onClose: { ... }
                    )
                }
                
                // Route preview drawer overlay
                if showingRoutePreviewDrawer, let route = selectedRouteForPreview {
                    RoutePreviewDrawer(
                        route: route,
                        onClose: { ... },
                        onViewDetails: {
                            // Store the selected route for navigation
                            selectedRoute = route
                            
                            // Close the drawer
                            showingRoutePreviewDrawer = false
                            selectedRouteForPreview = nil
                            
                            // Navigate to route detail view
                            navigateToRouteDetail = true
                        }
                    )
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Home")
            .navigationBarHidden(true)
            // Navigation link to route detail view
            .background(
                NavigationLink(
                    destination: selectedRoute != nil ? RouteDetailView(routeId: selectedRoute!.id) : nil,
                    isActive: $navigateToRouteDetail,
                    label: { EmptyView() }
                )
            )
        }
    }
}
```

The changes include:
- Adding a NavigationView to the HomeView
- Adding a NavigationLink to navigate to RouteDetailView
- Updating the onSelectRoute handler in RouteListDrawer to navigate to RouteDetailView
- Updating the onViewDetails handler in RoutePreviewDrawer to navigate to RouteDetailView

## Phase 2: Route Details Map Implementation (Completed)

**Status Update (May 18, 2025)**: Successfully implemented Phase 2, which enhances the route display on the map and improves the route information panel.

### Step 1: Implement MapViewRepresentable for Route Display (Completed)

Created a custom RouteMapViewRepresentable that displays the full route path on the map:

```swift
// Enhanced Route Map View Representable for displaying routes
struct RouteMapViewRepresentable: UIViewRepresentable {
    @Binding var cameraPosition: CameraOptions
    @Binding var mapView: MapView?
    var route: Route?
    var pois: [POI] = []
    var lines: [Line] = []
    var photos: [Photo] = []
    
    func makeUIView(context: Context) -> MapView {
        // Create a MapView with default options
        let mapInitOptions = MapInitOptions(
            styleURI: StyleURI.outdoors
        )
        
        let mapView = MapView(frame: .zero, mapInitOptions: mapInitOptions)
        
        // Set the camera position
        mapView.mapboxMap.setCamera(to: cameraPosition)
        
        // Add location puck (user's location)
        let locationOptions = LocationOptions()
        mapView.location.options = locationOptions
        
        // Store reference to the map view
        self.mapView = mapView
        
        // Set up gesture recognizers
        let tapGesture = UITapGestureRecognizer(target: context.coordinator, action: #selector(context.coordinator.handleMapTap(_:)))
        mapView.addGestureRecognizer(tapGesture)
        
        return mapView
    }
    
    func updateUIView(_ mapView: MapView, context: Context) {
        // Update the camera position
        mapView.mapboxMap.setCamera(to: cameraPosition)
        
        // Clear existing annotations
        clearAnnotations(mapView)
        
        // Add route polyline if available
        if let route = route, let coordinates = route.geojson?.features.first?.geometry.coordinates, !coordinates.isEmpty {
            addRoutePolyline(mapView, coordinates: coordinates, route: route)
        }
        
        // Add POIs, photos, and lines
        // ...
    }
    
    // Helper functions for adding route polyline, POIs, photos, and lines
    // ...
}
```

The implementation includes:
- Route polyline with proper styling based on route type
- Start and end markers for the route
- Special styling for unpaved sections (dashed orange lines)
- Camera positioning to focus on the route
- Support for POI and photo markers
- Support for additional line overlays

### Step 2: Implement Route Information Panel (Completed)

Enhanced the RouteInfoPanel component to display more detailed information:

```swift
// Route info panel component
struct RouteInfoPanel: View {
    let route: Route
    @Binding var isExpanded: Bool
    
    // Environment value for detecting dark mode
    @Environment(\.colorScheme) private var colorScheme
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 12) {
            // Header with route name and expand/collapse button
            HStack {
                Text(route.name)
                    .font(.title2)
                    .fontWeight(.bold)
                
                Spacer()
                
                Button(action: {
                    isExpanded.toggle()
                }) {
                    Image(systemName: isExpanded ? "chevron.down" : "chevron.up")
                        .foregroundColor(.secondary)
                        .padding(8)
                        .background(Color.secondary.opacity(0.1))
                        .clipShape(Circle())
                }
            }
            
            if isExpanded {
                // Route statistics, surface information, location, and description
                // ...
            }
        }
        .padding()
        .background(colorScheme == .dark ? Color(UIColor.systemBackground) : .white)
        .cornerRadius(16)
        .shadow(radius: 4)
        .padding()
    }
}
```

The enhanced panel includes:
- Collapsible design to allow for more map viewing space
- More detailed route statistics (distance, elevation gain, elevation loss)
- Surface type information (paved, mixed, unpaved)
- Location information with icon
- Route description (if available)
- Better styling and layout

### Enhanced RouteDetailViewModel (Completed)

Updated the RouteDetailViewModel to better support the enhanced view:

```swift
class RouteDetailViewModel: ObservableObject {
    // Published properties for SwiftUI to observe
    @Published var route: Route?
    @Published var pois: [POI] = []
    @Published var lines: [Line] = []
    @Published var photos: [Photo] = []
    @Published var isLoading = false
    @Published var errorMessage: String?
    
    // Load route data from Firebase
    func loadRoute(persistentId: String) {
        // ...
    }
    
    // Process route data and update published properties
    private func processRouteData(_ loadedRoute: Route) {
        // ...
    }
    
    // Get camera bounds for the route
    func getCameraBounds() -> CoordinateBounds? {
        // ...
    }
    
    // Get route surface type
    func getRouteSurfaceType() -> String {
        // ...
    }
    
    // Get route elevation profile data for charts
    func getElevationProfileData() -> [(distance: Double, elevation: Double)] {
        // ...
    }
}
```

The enhanced view model includes:
- Better error handling and logging
- Methods for determining route surface type
- Methods for preparing elevation profile data (for Phase 3)
- Improved camera positioning logic

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Partially Completed)

**Status Update (May 18, 2025)**: Partially implemented Phase 3, which adds advanced features to the route details view including an interactive elevation profile, photo viewer, and POI details display. However, these features do not yet match the React Native implementation exactly.

### Step 1: Implement Elevation Profile (Partially Completed)

Created an ElevationProfileView component that displays the route's elevation profile, but it does not yet match the React Native implementation exactly:

```swift
// mobile/CyaTrails/CyaTrails/Views/ElevationProfileView.swift

struct ElevationProfileView: View {
    // Elevation profile data
    let profileData: [(distance: Double, elevation: Double)]
    
    // State for tracking hover position
    @State private var hoverPosition: CGFloat = -1
    @State private var hoverDistance: Double = 0
    @State private var hoverElevation: Double = 0
    
    // State for panel expansion
    @Binding var isExpanded: Bool
    
    // Environment value for detecting dark mode
    @Environment(\.colorScheme) private var colorScheme
    
    // Computed properties for chart dimensions
    private var minElevation: Double { ... }
    private var maxElevation: Double { ... }
    private var totalDistance: Double { ... }
    private var elevationRange: Double { ... }
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 0) {
            // Header with title and expand/collapse button
            HStack { ... }
            
            if isExpanded {
                // Elevation chart
                ZStack(alignment: .topLeading) {
                    // Chart background
                    Rectangle()
                        .fill(colorScheme == .dark ? Color.black.opacity(0.2) : Color.white.opacity(0.8))
                        .cornerRadius(8)
                    
                    // Elevation path
                    if profileData.count > 1 {
                        ElevationChartPath(...)
                            .stroke(Color.blue, lineWidth: 2)
                        
                        // Gradient fill
                        ElevationChartFill(...)
                            .fill(LinearGradient(...))
                        
                        // Hover indicator
                        if hoverPosition >= 0 {
                            // Tooltip and indicator
                        }
                    } else {
                        Text("No elevation data available")
                    }
                }
                .gesture(DragGesture(minimumDistance: 0)...)
                
                // Elevation stats
                HStack(spacing: 24) {
                    // Min, max, and gain stats
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Helper methods for calculations and interactions
}
```

The elevation profile includes:
- A collapsible panel with expand/collapse button
- A line chart showing the elevation profile with gradient fill
- Interactive hover functionality to show elevation and distance at specific points
- Statistics showing minimum elevation, maximum elevation, and total elevation gain
- Dark mode support

However, it does not yet match the React Native implementation exactly in terms of:
- Visual appearance (colors, styling, dimensions)
- Interaction behavior (gestures, animations)
- Gradient coloring based on slope percentage
- Unpaved section visualization

### Step 2: Implement Photo Display (Partially Completed)

Created a PhotoViewerView component to display photos associated with the route, but it does not yet match the React Native implementation exactly:

```swift
// mobile/CyaTrails/CyaTrails/Views/PhotoViewerView.swift

struct PhotoViewerView: View {
    // Photos to display
    let photos: [Photo]
    
    // Currently selected photo index
    @State private var currentIndex: Int
    
    // Binding to control visibility
    @Binding var isVisible: Bool
    
    // Environment value for detecting dark mode
    @Environment(\.colorScheme) private var colorScheme
    
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            // Semi-transparent background
            Color.black.opacity(0.8)
                .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)
                .onTapGesture { ... }
            
            // Main content
            VStack(spacing: 0) {
                // Header with close button
                HStack { ... }
                
                // Photo display
                if !photos.isEmpty {
                    GeometryReader { geometry in
                        TabView(selection: $currentIndex) {
                            ForEach(0..<photos.count, id: \.self) { index in
                                PhotoView(photo: photos[index], maxSize: geometry.size)
                                    .tag(index)
                            }
                        }
                        .tabViewStyle(PageTabViewStyle(indexDisplayMode: .never))
                    }
                    .gesture(DragGesture()...)
                } else {
                    Text("No photos to display")
                }
                
                // Caption and metadata
                if !photos.isEmpty {
                    VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 8) { ... }
                }
                
                // Navigation buttons
                HStack(spacing: 40) {
                    // Previous and next buttons
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Helper methods
}

// Individual photo view with zooming capability
struct PhotoView: View {
    let photo: Photo
    let maxSize: CGSize
    
    @State private var scale: CGFloat = 1.0
    @State private var lastScale: CGFloat = 1.0
    @State private var offset: CGSize = .zero
    @State private var lastOffset: CGSize = .zero
    
    var body: some View {
        GeometryReader { geometry in
            ZStack {
                // Photo loading with AsyncImage
                AsyncImage(url: URL(string: photo.url)) { phase in
                    // Handle different loading phases
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The photo viewer includes:
- A full-screen overlay with semi-transparent background
- Photo display with AsyncImage for loading images from URLs
- Swipe navigation between photos
- Pinch-to-zoom and pan gestures for interacting with photos
- Caption and metadata display
- Previous/next navigation buttons
- Error handling for failed image loading

However, it does not yet match the React Native implementation exactly in terms of:
- Visual appearance (Polaroid-style frame, styling, dimensions)
- Interaction behavior (gestures, animations)
- Route context information
- Map integration

### Step 3: Implement POI Display (Partially Completed)

Created a POIDetailsView component to display details for Points of Interest, but it does not yet match the React Native implementation exactly:

```swift
// mobile/CyaTrails/CyaTrails/Views/POIDetailsView.swift

struct POIDetailsView: View {
    // POI to display
    let poi: POI
    
    // Binding to control visibility
    @Binding var isVisible: Bool
    
    // Environment value for detecting dark mode
    @Environment(\.colorScheme) private var colorScheme
    
    // State for showing Google Maps
    @State private var showingGoogleMaps = false
    
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            // Semi-transparent background
            Color.black.opacity(0.5)
                .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)
                .onTapGesture { ... }
            
            // Main content
            VStack(spacing: 0) {
                // Header with category badge and close button
                HStack { ... }
                
                ScrollView {
                    VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 16) {
                        // POI name
                        Text(poi.name)
                            .font(.title2)
                            .fontWeight(.bold)
                        
                        // POI description
                        if let description = poi.description, !description.isEmpty { ... }
                        
                        // Mini map showing POI location
                        ZStack {
                            // Map view with marker
                            Map(coordinateRegion: .constant(...), annotationItems: [poi]) { ... }
                            
                            // Overlay button to open in maps
                            Button(action: { openInMaps() }) { ... }
                        }
                        
                        // Google Place info if available
                        if let googlePlaceId = poi.googlePlaceId, !googlePlaceId.isEmpty { ... }
                        
                        // Coordinates
                        VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 4) { ... }
                    }
                }
                
                // Action buttons
                HStack(spacing: 16) {
                    // Share and Navigate buttons
                }
            }
        }
        .sheet(isPresented: $showingGoogleMaps) { ... }
    }
    
    // Helper methods
}

// Safari view for showing web content
struct SafariView: UIViewControllerRepresentable {
    let url: URL
    
    func makeUIViewController(context: Context) -> SFSafariViewController { ... }
    func updateUIViewController(_ uiViewController: SFSafariViewController, context: Context) { ... }
}
```

The POI details view includes:
- A modal overlay with semi-transparent background
- POI name, description, and category display
- A mini map showing the POI location
- Buttons to open the POI in Apple Maps or Google Maps
- Coordinate display
- Share and navigate action buttons
- Category-based color coding
- Integration with SFSafariViewController for opening web links

However, it does not yet match the React Native implementation exactly in terms of:
- Visual appearance (drawer-style UI, styling, dimensions)
- Interaction behavior (gestures, animations)
- Category-based styling
- Google Places integration

## Known Issues

- ~~Error: "Missing argument labels 'type:geometry:properties:' in call"~~ (Fixed - May 18, 2025 - Used named parameters instead of positional arguments when initializing Feature struct)
- ~~The dashed line pattern for unpaved sections is not supported in the current version of the Mapbox SDK~~ (Fixed - May 18, 2025 - Implemented a micro-dashed line pattern with [0.5, 0.5] dash array and proper error handling)
- Some POI categories may not have appropriate icons - **CRITICAL: Must find SF Symbols icons that EXACTLY match React Native icons**
- The photo viewer may have performance issues with very large images - **CRITICAL: Must optimize while maintaining EXACT visual matching**
- **CRITICAL: Route tabs in elevation drawer do not EXACTLY match React Native implementation in appearance and behavior**
- **CRITICAL: Elevation profile visualization does not EXACTLY match React Native implementation**
- **CRITICAL: Minimized view of elevation drawer does not EXACTLY match React Native implementation**
- **CRITICAL: Route selection and navigation controls do not EXACTLY match React Native implementation**

## Critical Gaps Requiring Immediate Attention

1. **Elevation Drawer UI and Behavior (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**:
   - The elevation drawer must EXACTLY match the React Native implementation as shown in the screenshots
   - Two distinct views must be implemented:
     - **Expanded View**: Shows horizontal tabs at top ("Overview", "Stage 1", "Stage 2", etc.), detailed elevation profile with gradient coloring, key stats (distance, elevation gain, surface type), and route description section
     - **Minimized View**: Shows just "Overview" with right arrow and three key stats (distance, elevation gain, unpaved percentage)
   - Gesture handling must match exactly with identical physics parameters
   - Drawer states (collapsed, minimized, expanded) must have identical heights and transitions

2. **Route Selection and Navigation**:
   - Route tabs must be prominently displayed at the top of the drawer exactly as in React Native
   - "Overview" tab must be first, followed by individual route tabs (which represent separate routes in the file, not stages)
   - Tabs must have underline indicator for active tab with proper coloring
   - Navigation controls in minimized view must match exactly
   - Visual indicators for the current route must match exactly

3. **Elevation Profile Visualization**:
   - Detailed elevation chart with gradient fill (blue to light blue)
   - Colored sections based on gradient percentage (green, yellow, orange, red)
   - Tracer that follows hover coordinates must match exactly
   - Stats display must include identical icons and layout

4. **Additional Content Sections**:
   - Route description section must match exactly
   - Weather forecast and historical weather sections must match exactly
   - Action buttons must match exactly

## Implementation Priority (May 18, 2025)

Based on the screenshots provided and the current state of the implementation, the following priorities have been established:

1. **CRITICAL**: Completely redesign the ElevationDrawerView.swift to match the screenshots exactly
   - Implement the minimized view with "Overview" and right arrow as shown in the second screenshot
   - Implement the expanded view with tabs, stats, elevation profile, and route description as shown in the first screenshot
   - Ensure exact visual matching of all UI elements, spacing, typography, and colors

2. **CRITICAL**: Implement proper route selection and navigation
   - Ensure the tabs allow switching between routes
   - Implement proper visual indicators for the current route
   - Ensure the elevation profile updates correctly when switching routes

3. **HIGH**: Enhance the elevation profile visualization
   - Implement proper gradient coloring and section visualization
   - Ensure the elevation chart matches the React Native implementation exactly
   - Implement proper stats display with icons and layout

4. **MEDIUM**: Add route description and additional content
   - Implement the route description section
   - Add weather forecast and historical weather sections
   - Implement action buttons

5. **LOW**: Enhance photo viewer and POI details view
   - Update these components once the elevation drawer is properly implemented
   - Ensure they match the React Native implementation exactly

## Future Enhancements (Only After EXACT Matching is Achieved)

1. **Offline Photo Support**:
   - Implement caching for photos to allow viewing when offline
   - Add option to download all route photos for offline use
   - **NOTE: Must maintain EXACT visual matching with React Native implementation**

2. **Enhanced Elevation Profile**:
   - Add slope gradient coloring to the elevation profile
   - Implement a moving tracer that follows the user's position on the route
   - Add elevation profile segments that match the route's unpaved sections
   - **NOTE: Must maintain EXACT visual matching with React Native implementation**

3. **POI Filtering**:
   - Add ability to filter POIs by category
   - Implement a POI list view that shows all POIs in a list format
   - **NOTE: Must maintain EXACT visual matching with React Native implementation**

4. **Route Sharing**:
   - Add ability to share the route with others
   - Implement export to GPX/KML functionality
   - **NOTE: Must maintain EXACT visual matching with React Native implementation**

5. **Route Navigation**:
   - Add turn-by-turn navigation functionality
   - Implement route following with progress tracking
   - **NOTE: Must maintain EXACT visual matching with React Native implementation**
