# Photo Modal Map Panning Fix

## Issue
The map panning functionality was not working properly on desktop when cycling between photos in presentation mode. The map would not consistently pan to the new photo's location when navigating between photos using the next/previous buttons.

## Root Cause
1. **Split Map Operations**: The map.easeTo() operation was split into two parts for desktop:
   - First, it would center the map without changing pitch
   - Then, after a 100ms delay, it would apply a pitch change to 60 degrees
   
   This two-step approach caused issues with the navigation between photos, as the second operation would sometimes override or conflict with the first.

2. **Inconsistent Pitch Values**: There were inconsistencies in the pitch values used across different parts of the code:
   - PhotoModal's initial load effect: 60 degrees for desktop
   - Navigation handlers (handleNext/handlePrev): 60 degrees for desktop
   - PresentationPhotoLayer's onClick handler: 30 degrees for desktop
   - PresentationPhotoLayer's handleClusterClick: 30 degrees for desktop

## Solution
1. **Simplified Map Operations**:
   - Changed the initial photo loading effect to use a single map.easeTo() call that includes both centering and pitch adjustment
   - This makes the behavior more consistent with the navigation handlers

2. **Standardized Pitch Values**:
   - Used a consistent pitch value of 60 degrees for desktop across all map.easeTo() calls
   - Updated both PhotoModal.jsx and PresentationPhotoLayer.js to use the same pitch value

3. **Improved Code Comments**:
   - Added clear comments to indicate the consistent pitch value across components
   - Explained the rationale for using different values on mobile vs. desktop

## Files Modified
1. `src/features/presentation/components/PhotoLayer/PhotoModal.jsx`
   - Simplified the initial photo loading effect to use a single map.easeTo() call
   - Removed the delayed pitch adjustment that was causing issues

2. `src/features/presentation/components/PhotoLayer/PresentationPhotoLayer.js`
   - Updated the onClick handler for photo markers to use 60 degrees pitch on desktop
   - Updated the handleClusterClick function to use 60 degrees pitch on desktop
   - Added comments to indicate the consistency with PhotoModal

## Benefits
1. **Consistent Behavior**: The map now pans consistently when cycling between photos on desktop
2. **Improved User Experience**: Users will have a smoother experience when navigating through photos
3. **Maintainable Code**: Using consistent pitch values makes the code easier to maintain and understand
4. **Performance**: Simplified map operations reduce the chance of conflicts or race conditions

## Testing
The changes have been tested on both desktop and mobile devices to ensure:
1. Map panning works correctly when cycling through photos
2. The pitch is applied correctly on desktop (60 degrees)
3. No pitch is applied on mobile devices (0 degrees)
4. The transition duration is appropriate for both desktop and mobile
