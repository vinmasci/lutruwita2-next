# Session Summary: Location Filter Chips Implementation (May 29, 2025)

## üéØ Goal
The primary goal of this session was to implement a new "Location Filter Chips" feature on the `HomeView` of the CyaTrails mobile application. This feature aims to allow users to filter displayed routes based on geographic regions (countries and states), with corresponding map camera adjustments.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features Implemented
- **Location-Based Filtering**: Users can select a country (defaulting to Australia) and then a state within that country.
- **Chip UI**:
    - An "Other" chip to select countries not initially displayed.
    - A default "AUS" (Australia) chip, styled in red when active.
    - State chips (e.g., TAS, VIC) appear when a country is selected, styled in black until selected.
- **Map Integration**:
    - Selecting a country zooms the map to its bounds.
    - Selecting a state zooms the map to that state's bounds.
    - User location zoom functionality was removed as per requirements.
- **Route Filtering**: The list of displayed routes updates based on the selected geographic region.
- **Modal for "Other" Countries**: A sheet (modal) displays other available countries for selection.
- **Dark/Light Mode Support**: UI elements adapt to the system's color scheme.

## üõ†Ô∏è Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:
1.  **`mobile/CyaTrails/CyaTrails/Models/GeographicModels.swift`**:
    *   Defines `Region` and `Country` structs to hold geographic data (name, abbreviation, bounds, states).
2.  **`mobile/CyaTrails/CyaTrails/Utils/GeographicDataStore.swift`**:
    *   Provides static data for Australia (and its states) and New Zealand.
    *   Includes `CoordinateBounds` for map zooming.
3.  **`mobile/CyaTrails/CyaTrails/Views/LocationFilterChipsView.swift`**:
    *   The main SwiftUI view for displaying and handling interactions with the location filter chips.
    *   Includes `ChipButton` helper struct.
    *   Manages the display of country and state chips.
    *   Handles tap actions to update selections and trigger map/route updates via the `RouteListViewModel`.

### Existing Files Modified:
1.  **`mobile/CyaTrails/CyaTrails/ViewModels/RouteListViewModel.swift`**:
    *   Added `@Published` properties for `selectedCountryRegion` and `selectedStateRegion`.
    *   Added `availableCountries` and logic to update filtered routes based on selected regions.
    *   Integrated logic to update map camera based on region selection.
2.  **`mobile/CyaTrails/CyaTrails/Views/HomeView.swift`**:
    *   Integrated `LocationFilterChipsView`.
    *   Added `@State` for `showingOtherCountriesSheet`.
    *   Modified `.onAppear` and `.onChange` blocks to handle camera updates based on `RouteListViewModel`'s selected regions.
    *   **Significant Refactoring**: Addressed SwiftUI compiler errors ("unable to type-check this expression in reasonable time") by:
        *   Extracting `TypeFilterSection` and `DistanceFilterSection` into separate `View` structs.
        *   Further extracting `mapWithOverlay` and `routePreviewOverlay` into computed properties.
        *   Cleaning up a corrupted file state that included duplicated code.
        *   Correcting `CameraOptions` API calls from `CameraOptions(bounds: ...)` to `CameraOptions.fittingCoordinateBounds(...)`.
3.  **`docs/LOCATION_FILTER_CHIPS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`**:
    *   Updated throughout the session to reflect progress and changes in the implementation plan.

## Ï±å Challenges Encountered & Solutions

The main challenge during this session was persistent SwiftUI compiler errors in `HomeView.swift`, specifically:
- "The compiler is unable to type-check this expression in reasonable time."
- Scope issues with computed properties.
- File corruption leading to duplicated code and syntax errors.

**Solutions Applied**:
1.  **View Extraction**: Initially, `TypeFilterSection` and `DistanceFilterSection` were extracted from the main `HomeView` body into separate `View` structs. This helped simplify the main body.
2.  **Computed Properties**: The `HomeView` body was further broken down by extracting `mapWithOverlay` and `routePreviewOverlay` into computed properties.
3.  **File Cleanup**: Identified and removed a large block of duplicated code within `HomeView.swift` that was causing structural errors.
4.  **API Correction**: Corrected the usage of `CameraOptions` for setting map bounds, changing from an incorrect `bounds` parameter to the static method `fittingCoordinateBounds()`.

## ‚è≥ Current Status (End of Session)
Despite the refactoring efforts, new compilation errors have emerged in `HomeView.swift`. The core logic for the location filter chips and the supporting data models and view model changes are largely in place. The immediate next step is to diagnose and resolve these new errors to achieve a successful build.
