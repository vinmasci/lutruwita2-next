# Map Overview Save Integration

## Overview

This document describes the integration of the Map Overview feature with the unified save process improvements. The Map Overview is now fully integrated with the change tracking system, ensuring that changes to the map overview are properly tracked and saved along with photos, POIs, and line markers.

## Implementation Details

### 1. MapOverviewContext Changes

The `MapOverviewContext` has been enhanced to track changes to the map overview:

- Added a `localMapOverviewChanges` state to track changes locally when RouteContext is not available
- Added `notifyMapOverviewChange` function to mark map overview as changed in both local state and RouteContext
- Added `hasMapOverviewChanges` function to check if there are pending changes
- Added `clearMapOverviewChanges` function to clear the change tracking after a successful save

### 2. mapOverviewStore Integration

The `mapOverviewStore.js` file has been updated to handle cases when RouteContext is not available:

- Enhanced the `markMapOverviewChanged` function to log when changes are being tracked locally
- Added better error handling and logging for debugging purposes

### 3. MapView Integration

The `MapView.js` component has been updated to include Map Overview changes in the unified save process:

- Added Map Overview context to the component to access change tracking functions
- Updated the `getTotalChangeCount` function to include Map Overview changes in the total count
- Updated the debug effect to log Map Overview changes alongside other changes
- Added code to clear Map Overview changes after a successful save in the `handleSaveDialogSubmit` function

### 4. EditableMapOverviewPanel Integration

The `EditableMapOverviewPanel` component was already using the MapOverviewContext to update the map overview description. With our changes to the MapOverviewContext, the component now automatically triggers change tracking when the map overview is updated.

## Benefits

1. **Unified Change Tracking**: Map Overview changes are now tracked alongside photos, POIs, and line markers
2. **Visual Feedback**: The commit button now reflects Map Overview changes in its count and color coding
3. **Optimized Saving**: Only changed elements are included in the save payload, reducing upload size
4. **Consistent User Experience**: The same save dialog is used for all types of changes, including Map Overview

## Testing

To test the Map Overview save integration:

1. Make changes to the Map Overview in the EditableMapOverviewPanel
2. Verify that the commit button appears and reflects the changes
3. Save the changes and verify that they are properly saved
4. Make additional changes and verify that the commit button appears again
5. Verify that the Map Overview changes are cleared after a successful save

## Future Improvements

1. **Automatic Saving**: Implement automatic saving of Map Overview changes after a certain period of inactivity
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Implement conflict resolution for collaborative editing of the Map Overview
3. **Version History**: Add support for viewing and restoring previous versions of the Map Overview
4. **Offline Support**: Add support for offline editing of the Map Overview with local storage
