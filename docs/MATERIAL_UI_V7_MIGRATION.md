# Material UI v7 Migration Guide

This document outlines the steps taken to migrate from Material UI v6 to v7 to fix React key prop warnings.

## Changes Made

1. Updated package versions in package.json:
   - `@mui/material`: ^6.4.5 → ^7.0.2
   - `@mui/icons-material`: ^6.3.1 → ^7.0.2
   - `@mui/x-date-pickers` remains at ^7.28.2 (already compatible)

## Potential Breaking Changes

Material UI v7 includes several breaking changes from v6. Here are the most important ones to be aware of:

1. **Key Prop Handling**: Material UI v7 has improved how it handles the `key` prop in components, which should fix the warnings you were seeing. Components now properly extract the key prop before spreading other props.

2. **Theme Structure Changes**: There might be changes to the theme structure or default theme values. If you're using a custom theme, you may need to update it.

3. **Component API Changes**: Some components might have updated APIs or prop names. Check the official migration guide for specific component changes.

4. **Style System Updates**: There might be changes to how styles are applied or the default styling of components.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues after upgrading:

1. **Check Console Warnings**: Look for any new warnings in the console that might indicate needed changes.

2. **Component Rendering Issues**: If components don't render as expected, check if their API has changed in v7.

3. **Style Issues**: If styling looks different, you may need to update your theme or component-specific styles.

4. **Peer Dependencies**: Make sure all peer dependencies are compatible with the new version.

## Why This Fixes the Key Prop Warnings

The warnings you were seeing occurred because:

1. React 18.3 is more strict about how keys are handled in JSX elements
2. Material UI v6 components were using a pattern where they accept a props object that might include a key, and then spread that object into a JSX element
3. Material UI v7 has updated its component implementation to properly extract the key prop before spreading other props

This upgrade should resolve the warnings without requiring changes to your application code.
