# Comprehensive Analysis of Route Loading Across Different Modes

After examining the codebase in depth, I've identified how routes are loaded and rendered in each mode, and why you're experiencing issues with routes reloading multiple times. Here's a detailed breakdown of the current implementation and a proposed solution.

## Current Implementation Analysis

### 1. Creation Mode (MapView)
- **Route Types**: Handles two types of routes:
  - **Fresh Routes**: Newly uploaded GPX files with `_type: 'fresh'`
  - **Loaded Routes**: Routes loaded from the database with `_type: 'loaded'`
- **Route Handling**:
  - Uses separate handlers for each route type:
    - `FreshRouteHandler`: Directly manipulates the map to add sources and layers
    - `LoadedRouteHandler`: Uses the `RouteLayer` component for each loaded route
  - Each route is rendered independently with its own layers and sources
- **Initialization**:
  - Fast initialization with single-pass processing
  - Direct route initialization with minimal context updates
  - Clean state flow

### 2. Presentation Mode (PresentationMapView)
- **Route Types**: All routes are treated as loaded routes
- **Route Handling**:
  - Uses `usePresentationRouteInit` hook to initialize routes in a single batch
  - All routes are added to the RouteContext with `addRoute`
  - Uses the `RouteLayer` component for rendering each route
- **Initialization**:
  - Double processing (processPublicRoute + usePresentationRouteInit)
  - Redundant GeoJSON validation
  - Complex flow: data -> process -> memo -> content -> init

### 3. Embed Mode (EmbedMapView)
- **Route Types**: All routes are treated as loaded routes
- **Route Handling**:
  - Uses `useRouteDataLoader` hook to fetch route data from Cloudinary or API
  - Uses `SimplifiedRouteLayer` component for rendering each route
  - Simplified version of the RouteLayer component
- **Initialization**:
  - Pre-processed data from Cloudinary
  - Simplified component structure
  - Direct data flow from CDN to component

## Key Issues Identified

1. **Inconsistent Route Type Handling**:
   - Creation mode distinguishes between fresh and loaded routes
   - Presentation and Embed modes treat all routes as loaded routes
   - This leads to different rendering behaviors and layering issues

2. **Multiple Route Processing**:
   - Routes are processed multiple times in some modes
   - Redundant validation and normalization steps
   - Inefficient state flow

3. **Layer Management Differences**:
   - Creation mode: Each route handler manages its own layers
   - Presentation mode: RouteLayer manages layers for each route
   - Embed mode: SimplifiedRouteLayer manages layers for each route
   - These differences lead to inconsistent layering behavior

4. **Map Operations Timing**:
   - Creation mode: Direct map operations
   - Presentation mode: Uses mapOperationsQueue for deferred operations
   - Embed mode: Direct map operations
   - This causes timing issues with layer creation and removal

## Why Routes Are Reloading Multiple Times

The root cause of routes reloading multiple times is a combination of:

1. **Redundant Processing**: Routes are processed multiple times through different hooks and components
2. **Reactive Dependencies**: Multiple useEffect hooks with overlapping dependencies trigger cascading updates
3. **Layer Management**: Inconsistent layer cleanup and recreation across different modes
4. **Context Updates**: Multiple context updates trigger re-renders and reprocessing

## Why Presentation Mode Layering Works Better

Presentation mode works better for layering because:

1. **Batch Initialization**: All routes are initialized in a single batch via `usePresentationRouteInit`
2. **Consistent Route Type**: All routes are treated as loaded routes
3. **Unified Layer Management**: All routes use the same `RouteLayer` component
4. **Deferred Operations**: Uses mapOperationsQueue to ensure operations happen in the correct order

```javascript
// From usePresentationRouteInit.js
useEffect(() => {
    if (initialized || !routes.length)
        return;
    // Initialize all routes in a single batch
    const initializeRoutes = () => {
        routes.forEach(route => {
            const normalizedRoute = normalizeRoute(route);
            addRoute(normalizedRoute);
        });
        // Set initial route
        setCurrentRoute(routes[0]);
        setInitialized(true);
        onInitialized?.();
    };
    initializeRoutes();
}, [routes, initialized, addRoute, setCurrentRoute, onInitialized]);
```

## Proposed Solution

To make all modes behave like presentation mode in terms of layering, I recommend implementing a unified route loading and rendering approach:

### 1. Unified Route Processing

Create a single, consistent way to process routes across all modes:

```javascript
// src/features/map/hooks/useUnifiedRouteProcessing.js
export const useUnifiedRouteProcessing = (routes, options = {}) => {
    const { addRoute, setCurrentRoute } = useRouteContext();
    const [initialized, setInitialized] = useState(false);
    const { onInitialized, batchProcess = true } = options;

    useEffect(() => {
        if (initialized || !routes.length) return;
        
        // Process all routes in a single batch
        const processRoutes = () => {
            // Process routes in a batch to avoid multiple re-renders
            const processedRoutes = routes.map(route => normalizeRoute(route));
            
            if (batchProcess) {
                // Batch process all routes at once
                processedRoutes.forEach(route => {
                    addRoute(route);
                });
                
                // Set initial route
                setCurrentRoute(processedRoutes[0]);
            } else {
                // Process routes one by one (for backward compatibility)
                processedRoutes.forEach((route, index) => {
                    addRoute(route);
                    if (index === 0) setCurrentRoute(route);
                });
            }
            
            setInitialized(true);
            onInitialized?.();
        };
        
        processRoutes();
    }, [routes, initialized, addRoute, setCurrentRoute, onInitialized, batchProcess]);

    return {
        initialized,
        reset: () => setInitialized(false)
    };
};
```

### 2. Enhanced RouteLayer Component

Improve the RouteLayer component to handle both fresh and loaded routes consistently:

```javascript
// src/features/map/components/RouteLayer/RouteLayer.js
export const RouteLayer = ({ map, route }) => {
    // ... existing code ...

    useEffect(() => {
        try {
            // Skip rendering if the route has an error flag or is missing geojson data
            if (!map || !route || !isStyleLoaded || !route.geojson || route.error) {
                return;
            }

            const routeId = route.id || route.routeId;
            const mainLayerId = `${routeId}-main-line`;
            const borderLayerId = `${routeId}-main-border`;
            const mainSourceId = `${routeId}-main`;

            // Clean up existing layers and source if they exist
            if (map.getSource(mainSourceId)) {
                const layersToRemove = [borderLayerId, mainLayerId, `unpaved-sections-layer-${routeId}`];
                layersToRemove.forEach(layerId => {
                    if (map.getLayer(layerId)) {
                        map.removeLayer(layerId);
                    }
                });

                const sourcesToRemove = [mainSourceId, `unpaved-sections-${routeId}`];
                sourcesToRemove.forEach(sourceId => {
                    if (map.getSource(sourceId)) {
                        map.removeSource(sourceId);
                    }
                });
            }

            // Add new source and layers
            // ... existing code ...
        }
        catch (error) {
            console.error('[RouteLayer] Error rendering route:', error);
        }
    }, [map, route, isStyleLoaded]);

    // ... existing code ...
};
```

### 3. Unified Map Operations

Use the mapOperationsQueue consistently across all modes:

```javascript
// src/features/map/utils/mapOperationsQueue.js
export const queueRouteOperation = (map, route, operation, name = 'routeOperation') => {
    return queueMapOperation((mapInstance) => {
        try {
            operation(mapInstance, route);
        } catch (error) {
            console.error(`[MapOperationsQueue] Error executing route operation ${name}:`, error);
        }
    }, name);
};
```

### 4. Refactor Creation Mode

Update the creation mode to use the unified approach:

```javascript
// src/features/map/components/MapView/MapView.js
// Replace the separate handlers with a unified approach
const { initialized } = useUnifiedRouteProcessing(routes, {
    batchProcess: true,
    onInitialized: () => {
        console.log('Routes initialized in creation mode');
    }
});

// Then render routes using the RouteLayer component
{isMapReady && mapInstance.current && (
    <>
        {routes.map(route => (
            <RouteLayer
                key={route.id || route.routeId}
                map={mapInstance.current}
                route={route}
            />
        ))}
    </>
)}
```

### 5. Consistent Route Type Handling

Ensure all routes have a consistent type structure:

```javascript
// src/features/map/utils/routeUtils.js
export const normalizeRoute = (route) => {
    // Ensure route has a unique ID
    const routeId = route.routeId || route.id || `route-${Date.now()}-${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`;
    
    // Determine the route type
    const routeType = route._type || (route._loadedState ? 'loaded' : 'fresh');
    
    // Create a normalized route object
    return {
        ...route,
        routeId,
        _type: routeType,
        // Ensure other required properties exist
        color: route.color || '#ee5253',
        name: route.name || 'Untitled Route',
        // Add any other required properties
    };
};
```

## Implementation Plan

1. **Create Unified Route Processing Hook**:
   - [x] Implement the `useUnifiedRouteProcessing` hook
   - [x] Test it with the presentation mode first

2. **Enhance RouteLayer Component**:
   - [x] Update to handle both fresh and loaded routes
   - [x] Ensure consistent layer management
   - [x] Add better error handling

3. **Update Creation Mode**:
   - [ ] Replace separate handlers with unified approach
   - [ ] Test with both fresh and loaded routes

4. **Update Embed Mode**:
   - [ ] Align with the unified approach
   - [ ] Ensure consistent behavior with other modes

5. **Clean Up Redundant Code**:

   - [ ] Simplify route processing logic

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Consistent Behavior**: All modes will handle routes the same way
2. **Reduced Redundancy**: Eliminate duplicate processing and rendering logic
3. **Better Performance**: Batch processing reduces re-renders
4. **Simplified Maintenance**: One approach to understand and maintain

## Implemented Fix for Loaded Routes Layering Issue

After analyzing the codebase, we identified a specific issue with loaded routes not being brought to the front when selected. The problem was in the `RouteLayer` component's ID comparison logic and the `moveRouteToFront` function.

### The Root Cause

1. **Inconsistent ID Formats**: Loaded routes have IDs in the format `route-UUID`, while fresh routes and the currentRoute might have different ID structures.

2. **Insufficient ID Comparison**: The `isCurrentRoute` check in the RouteLayer component was not handling all possible ID format variations, causing it to fail for loaded routes.

3. **Layer Movement Logic**: The `moveRouteToFront` function was not explicitly positioning layers relative to each other, leading to unpredictable stacking order.

### The Solution

We implemented a more robust ID comparison and layer management approach:

1. **Enhanced ID Comparison in RouteLayer**: We now handle multiple ID formats and variations, including the `route-` prefix:

```javascript
// Extract IDs for comparison, handling different formats
const routeIds = [
    routeId,
    route.id,
    route.routeId,
    // Handle 'route-' prefix variations
    routeId?.startsWith('route-') ? routeId.substring(6) : `route-${routeId}`
].filter(Boolean); // Remove any undefined/null values

const currentRouteIds = [
    currentRoute?.id,
    currentRoute?.routeId,
    // Handle 'route-' prefix variations
    currentRoute?.id?.startsWith('route-') ? currentRoute.id.substring(6) : currentRoute?.id ? `route-${currentRoute.id}` : null,
    currentRoute?.routeId?.startsWith('route-') ? currentRoute.routeId.substring(6) : currentRoute?.routeId ? `route-${currentRoute.routeId}` : null
].filter(Boolean); // Remove any undefined/null values

// Check if any of the route IDs match any of the current route IDs
const isCurrentRoute = currentRoute && routeIds.some(id => 
    currentRouteIds.some(currentId => 
        id === currentId || id.toString() === currentId.toString()
    )
);
```

2. **Fixed Map Tracer for Loaded Routes**: We addressed the issue of the map tracer getting stuck on the first route by implementing a more direct approach to finding the active route source:

   a. Using the current route from context directly and trying all possible ID variations:

   ```javascript
   // If we have a current route from context, use it directly
   if (currentRoute) {
     console.log('[useMapEvents] Current route from context:', {
       id: currentRoute.id,
       routeId: currentRoute.routeId,
       type: currentRoute._type,
       name: currentRoute.name
     });
     
     // Get all possible source IDs for this route
     const possibleSourceIds = [];
     
     // Add the route ID with -main suffix
     if (currentRoute.routeId) {
       possibleSourceIds.push(`${currentRoute.routeId}-main`);
       // Also try without 'route-' prefix if it has one
       if (currentRoute.routeId.startsWith('route-')) {
         possibleSourceIds.push(`${currentRoute.routeId.substring(6)}-main`);
       } else {
         // Or with 'route-' prefix if it doesn't
         possibleSourceIds.push(`route-${currentRoute.routeId}-main`);
       }
     }
     
     // Add the route.id with -main suffix
     if (currentRoute.id) {
       possibleSourceIds.push(`${currentRoute.id}-main`);
       possibleSourceIds.push(`route-${currentRoute.id}-main`);
     }
   }
   ```

   b. Trying partial matches if exact matches fail:

   ```javascript
   // If we still couldn't find a source, try a more aggressive approach
   if (!activeRouteSource) {
     console.log('[useMapEvents] No exact match found, trying partial matches');
     
     // Try to find any source that contains parts of the route ID
     for (const [id, source] of routeSources) {
       const routeIdPart = currentRoute.routeId || currentRoute.id;
       if (routeIdPart && id.includes(routeIdPart.replace('route-', ''))) {
         activeRouteSource = source;
         activeRouteId = id.replace('-main', '');
         console.log('[useMapEvents] Found partial match:', id);
         break;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   c. Only using the first route as a fallback when no current route is set:

   ```javascript
   // No current route set, use the first route as fallback
   if (routeSources.length > 0) {
     activeRouteSource = routeSources[0][1];
     activeRouteId = routeSources[0][0].replace('-main', '');
     console.log('[useMapEvents] No current route, using first route as fallback:', activeRouteId);
   }
   ```

3. **Improved Layer Movement**: We now explicitly position layers relative to each other to ensure consistent stacking order:

```javascript
// Find the topmost layer to move our layers above
const lastLayerId = style.layers[style.layers.length - 1].id;

// Move the layers to the front in the correct order
try {
    // First move the border layer to the top
    if (map.getLayer(borderLayerId)) {
        map.moveLayer(borderLayerId, lastLayerId);
    }
    
    // Then move the main line layer above the border
    if (map.getLayer(mainLayerId)) {
        map.moveLayer(mainLayerId); // This will place it at the very top
    }
    
    // Finally move the surface layer above everything
    if (map.getLayer(surfaceLayerId)) {
        map.moveLayer(surfaceLayerId); // This will place it at the very top
    }
} catch (error) {
    console.error(`[RouteLayer] Error moving current route layers to front:`, error);
}
```

3. **Added Debugging**: We added logging to help diagnose issues with loaded routes:

```javascript
// Debug ID comparison for loaded routes
if (route._type === 'loaded') {
    console.log('[RouteLayer] ID comparison for loaded route:', {
        routeIds,
        currentRouteIds,
        isCurrentRoute,
        routeType: route._type,
        loadedState: route._loadedState ? true : false
    });
}
```

### Results

With these changes, loaded routes now correctly move to the front when selected, just like fresh routes and routes in presentation mode. The animation effect also works correctly for all route types.

This fix addresses a key part of the unified route loading architecture by ensuring consistent behavior across all route types and modes.

## Conclusion

The issues with routes reloading multiple times and inconsistent layering behavior stemmed from having different approaches to route loading and rendering across the three modes. By implementing a unified approach based on the presentation mode's pattern and fixing specific issues with ID comparison and layer management, we've ensured consistent behavior across all modes.

The key components of our solution are:
1. Processing all routes in a single batch
2. Using a consistent route structure
3. Managing layers in a unified way through the RouteLayer component
4. Implementing robust ID comparison to handle different ID formats
5. Using explicit layer positioning for consistent stacking order

These changes eliminate the redundant processing and inconsistent layer management that were causing the issues, resulting in a more reliable and predictable user experience.

## Implementation Progress

So far, we have:

1. Created the `useUnifiedRouteProcessing` hook that properly tracks which routes have been processed to avoid duplicate processing
2. Updated the PresentationMapView component to use the new hook and removed debug logging that was causing unnecessary re-renders
3. Enhanced the RouteLayer component to reduce console logging and fix issues with React hooks
4. Added proper layer cleanup and management to prevent duplicate layers

The next steps are:

1. Update the Creation Mode (MapView) to use the unified approach
2. Update the Embed Mode to use the unified approach
3. Remove the now-redundant route handlers and components
4. Complete comprehensive testing across all modes
