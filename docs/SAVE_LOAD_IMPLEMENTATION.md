# Save/Load Implementation Plan

## Current Status

### Completed Backend Components
1. ✅ MongoDB Schema and Types
   - Created route.types.ts with all necessary interfaces
   - Implemented MongoDB schema in route.model.ts
   - Added proper indexes and validation

2. ✅ Authentication Middleware
   - Implemented Auth0 middleware
   - Added user extraction and validation
   - Set up proper error handling

3. ✅ Route Controller and Service
   - Created route.controller.ts with CRUD endpoints
   - Implemented route.service.ts with business logic
   - Added proper TypeScript types and error handling

4. ✅ Route Routes
   - Set up route.routes.ts with all endpoints
   - Added authentication middleware
   - Implemented proper request handling

### Frontend Progress
1. Frontend Implementation
   - [✓] Create routeService.ts for API calls
   - [✓] Implement useRouteState hook
   - [✓] Add save/load methods to RouteContext
   - [✓] Connect with other contexts

2. UI Integration
   - [✓] Add loading states to save/load icons
   - [✓] Implement error handling components
   - [✓] Add success feedback
   - [✓] Test user flows

### Recent Progress

1. Backend Server Configuration
   - ✅ Added Auth0 environment variables to server/.env from .env.local
   - ✅ Fixed TypeScript module resolution issues by removing .js extensions from imports
   - ✅ Backend server now running successfully on port 8080
   - ✅ Frontend server running on port 3003

### Current Issues

1. UI Issues (Still Present)
   - Save and load icons in the sidebar are still not functioning
   - No console logs appear when clicking the icons, suggesting event handlers are not being triggered
   - This may indicate an issue with event binding or component rendering
   - Further investigation needed in RouteList.tsx and related components

3. Context Integration
   - Fixed TypeScript errors in RouteContext.tsx by:
     * Adding hasGps property to photo state
     * Using correct context methods (addPhoto, addPOI, updatePlace) instead of setters
     * Updating dependency arrays to use the correct function names
   - Added extensive debugging logs throughout the save flow:
     * In RouteList.tsx to track button clicks and form submissions
     * In RouteContext.tsx to track state preparation
     * In routeService.ts to track API calls and responses

4. Next Steps for Investigation
   - Verify event handlers in RouteList.tsx are properly bound
   - Check if the save button's disabled state is being incorrectly set
   - Add error boundary to catch and display any silent failures
   - Configure missing Auth0 environment variables
   - Add more granular error logging in the frontend components

### Next Steps

1. Fix Context Integration
   - Update POIContext, PhotoContext, and PlaceContext to expose setter functions
   - Update corresponding TypeScript interfaces
   - Fix dependency array in RouteContext useCallback hooks

2. Fix Save Button
   - Debug sidebar save button functionality
   - Ensure proper event handling
   - Add error feedback for failed saves

3. Testing
   - Implement comprehensive testing for save/load flows
   - Test error scenarios
   - Verify state management across contexts

## Testing Instructions

The save/load functionality is ready for testing once the current issues are resolved. Here's what to test:

1. Saving Routes:
   - Upload a GPX file to create a route
   - Click the "Save Current Route" button
   - Fill in the save form with:
     * Name (required)
     * Type (tourism/event/bikepacking/single)
     * Public/Private setting
   - Verify loading state appears during save
   - Verify success notification appears
   - Verify route appears in saved routes list

2. Loading Routes:
   - Click on a saved route in the list
   - Verify loading state appears
   - Verify route loads with all data:
     * GPX route data
     * Map state (zoom, center, etc.)
     * POIs
     * Photos
   - Verify success notification appears

3. Deleting Routes:
   - Click delete icon on a saved route
   - Verify route is removed from list
   - Verify success notification appears

4. Error Handling:
   - Test network errors (e.g., disconnect internet)
   - Verify error notifications appear
   - Test validation (e.g., empty route name)
   - Test auth errors (e.g., expired token)

## Notes

1. Implementation Details:
   - Frontend state management is in RouteContext.tsx
   - API calls are in routeService.ts
   - UI components are in RouteList.tsx
   - Hook abstraction in useRouteState.ts

2. Key Features:
   - Full TypeScript support
   - Error handling with user feedback
   - Loading states for all operations
   - Integration with other contexts (Map, POI, Photo, Place)

3. Known Limitations:
   - Route names must be unique per user
   - No offline support
   - No route versioning
   - No batch operations

4. Potential Improvements:
   - Add confirmation dialog for delete
   - Add route type filtering
   - Add route search functionality
   - Add bulk operations
   - Add route sharing between users
