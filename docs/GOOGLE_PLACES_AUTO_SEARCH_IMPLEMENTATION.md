# Google Places Auto-Search Feature Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the Google Places auto-search feature for POIs (Points of Interest) in the application. This feature allows users to automatically search for places by name and coordinates when creating or editing POIs.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Google Places Service Updates

The `googlePlacesService.js` file was updated to:

- Generate embed links instead of regular Google Maps links in the `searchPlacesByNameAndCoords()` function
- Use the format `https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=...` for embed links
- Include place ID and name in the embed URL

```javascript
// Create a Google Maps embed URL for this place
url: `https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3000!2d0!3d0!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s${place.place_id}!2s${encodeURIComponent(place.name)}!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1600000000000!5m2!1sen!2sus`
```

### 2. UI Component Updates

#### POIViewer.js

- Added auto-search functionality when editing an existing POI
- Simplified search results to only show place names
- Added debouncing to prevent excessive API calls
- Implemented search result selection to update POI name and Google Places link

```jsx
// Search results dropdown
searchResults.length > 0 && (
  <List sx={{ /* styles */ }}>
    {searchResults.map((place, index) => (
      <ListItem
        key={place.placeId}
        button
        onClick={() => handleSelectPlace(place)}
        sx={{ /* styles */ }}
      >
        <Typography color="white">
          {place.name}
        </Typography>
      </ListItem>
    ))}
  </List>
)
```

#### POIDetailsModal.jsx

- Added auto-search functionality when creating a new POI
- Simplified search results to only show place names
- Added loading indicator during search
- Implemented search result selection to update POI name and Google Places link

### 3. Limitations

- The auto-search feature only works in components where coordinates are available:
  - POIViewer: Works when editing existing POIs
  - POIDetailsModal: Works when creating POIs with known coordinates
  - POIDetailsDrawer: Does not work because coordinates are not available until the POI is placed on the map

## User Experience

1. When a user types a POI name in the name field, the system automatically searches for matching places near the POI's coordinates
2. A dropdown appears with search results showing place names
3. When a user selects a result, the system:
   - Updates the POI name with the place name
   - Sets the Google Places link to the place's embed URL
   - Fetches and displays detailed place information

## Benefits

- Streamlines the POI creation process
- Reduces manual effort in finding and copying Google Places links
- Ensures consistent and correct embed link format
- Improves data accuracy by using official Google Places information

## Future Improvements

- Add caching to reduce API calls
- Implement search in POIDetailsDrawer after POI placement
- Add more details to search results (optional)
- Add filtering options for search results
