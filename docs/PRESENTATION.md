- ðŸ”„ Public route loading issue:
  - Added detailed logging throughout the route loading flow
  - Fixed route data processing in RoutePresentation component
  - Added proper error handling and logging in RouteLayer component
  - Enhanced logging in route service for better debugging
  - Fixed GeoJSON data access in route processing
  - Fixed map initialization and style loading in PresentationMapView
  - Added proper handling of map state updates when route changes
  - Added TypeScript types for route statistics and GeoJSON data

RECENT DEBUGGING EFFORTS:

1. Route Loading Flow Analysis:
   - Fixed savedRouteState initialization to properly include routes array
   - Added proper TypeScript types for GeoJSON features
   - Improved bounds calculation for route display
   - Added safety checks for coordinate handling

2. Potential Remaining Issues:
   a) Route Data Structure:
      - The route data might not be properly structured when coming from the public endpoint
      - Need to verify the shape of route.routes matches what RouteLayer expects
      - Possible mismatch between loaded state and fresh state handling

   b) Map Initialization:
      - Map style and terrain loading might complete before route data is ready
      - Need to ensure proper sequencing of map initialization and route rendering
      - Possible race condition between map ready state and route data loading

   c) GeoJSON Processing:
      - Current implementation assumes LineString geometry type
      - Need to handle potential MultiLineString or other geometry types
      - Coordinate processing might need to handle 3D coordinates (with elevation)

   d) Route Context Integration:
      - Route state management might not properly handle public routes
      - Need to verify route visibility and focus state handling
      - Possible issues with route type transitions (fresh -> loaded)

3. Next Steps for Investigation:
   - Add more detailed logging in RouteLayer component
   - Verify GeoJSON structure at each processing step
   - Compare public route loading flow with editor route loading
   - Add state transition logging in RouteContext
   - Implement proper error boundaries for route rendering
   - Add validation for route data structure
   - Consider adding route data normalization step

4. Potential Solutions to Explore:
   - âœ… Implement a dedicated public route processor
   - âœ… Add route data validation and normalization
   - âœ… Enhance error handling and recovery
   - âœ… Improve route state management
   - âœ… Add better debugging tools and logging

- Converted LandingPage component to use Material UI for consistent styling

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for a public-facing presentation mode that allows non-authenticated users to browse and view public maps. The system will maintain separation from the existing editor functionality while reusing components where appropriate.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Landing Page
- Serves as the entry point for all users
- Two primary paths:
  1. Sign up/login to create maps
  2. Browse public maps
- Features:
  - Featured maps showcase
  - Search/filter capabilities
  - Map previews
  - Clear call-to-action for map creation

### 2. Public Map Browser
- Grid/list view of available public maps
- Filtering options:
  - Region/location
  - Distance
  - Elevation gain
  - Number of segments
- Sort options:
  - Recently added
  - Most viewed
  - Distance (ascending/descending)
  - Elevation gain

### 3. Presentation View
- Simplified interface focused on viewing
- Reuses core map components
- Modified sidebar for segment navigation
- Read-only access to all map features

## Implementation Strategy
