# HTTPS Image URLs Fix

## Problem

The application was experiencing issues with photo captions not displaying correctly when viewing photos in the presentation mode. The root cause was identified as a mixed content issue:

1. The application is served over HTTPS (from Vercel)
2. Some image URLs in the database were using HTTP protocol
3. When the browser loads HTTP content on an HTTPS page, it automatically upgrades the URLs to HTTPS
4. This automatic upgrade was causing URL mismatches in the application's comparison logic
5. As a result, captions were not being correctly associated with their photos

Additionally, there was a debugging code block in `PresentationPhotoLayer.js` that was overwriting photo captions with a test caption:

```javascript
// For debugging - add a test caption to the first photo
if (photosWithCaptions.length > 0) {
    photosWithCaptions[0].caption = "This is a test caption added by the code";
    if (newIndex === 0) {
        stableSelectedPhoto.caption = "This is a test caption added by the code";
    }
}
```

## Solution

The solution involved several changes:

1. **Removed the test caption code** from `PresentationPhotoLayer.js`
2. **Added protocol-agnostic URL comparison** in `PhotoContext.js` to ensure URLs are compared correctly regardless of HTTP vs HTTPS
3. **Added URL normalization** to ensure all URLs use HTTPS consistently throughout the application
4. **Simplified the caption display logic** in `PhotoModal.jsx` to fix a TypeScript error and make the code more robust

### Key Changes

1. In `PhotoContext.js`:
   - Added `normalizeUrl` function to strip protocol for comparison
   - Added `ensureHttpsUrl` function to convert HTTP URLs to HTTPS
   - Updated the `loadPhotos` function to normalize URLs and ensure HTTPS

2. In `PresentationPhotoLayer.js`:
   - Removed the test caption code that was overwriting actual captions
   - Added logging for captions to help with debugging

3. In `PhotoModal.jsx`:
   - Simplified the caption display logic to avoid TypeScript errors
   - Made the caption display conditional on the caption existing and not being empty

## Benefits

These changes ensure that:

1. All image URLs use HTTPS consistently throughout the application
2. URL comparisons are protocol-agnostic, preventing mismatches between HTTP and HTTPS URLs
3. Captions are correctly preserved and displayed
4. The application works correctly with existing photos in the database without requiring any database migrations

## Future Recommendations

For future development:

1. Ensure all new uploads use HTTPS URLs consistently
2. Consider a database migration to update all existing URLs to use HTTPS
3. Add validation to ensure captions are properly preserved throughout the application
