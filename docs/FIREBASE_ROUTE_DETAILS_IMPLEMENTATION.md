# Firebase Route Details Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of Firebase as the data source for route details pages.

## Implementation Status

**âœ… Complete:** Firebase route details implementation is now working for the presentation view.

## Overview

The application now uses Firebase Firestore as the data source for route details pages. The implementation includes:

1. A Firebase public route service that handles fetching route data from Firestore
2. Support for loading route coordinates, POIs, lines, and photos
3. Adaptation of the presentation components to work with Firebase data structure
4. Security rules configuration to allow public access to route data

## Implementation Details

### 1. Firebase Public Route Service

The `firebasePublicRouteService.js` file has been updated to provide a `getPublicRoute` function that:

- Uses anonymous authentication to ensure access to routes that require authentication
- First checks if the route exists in the `routes` collection, which has a hierarchical structure
- If not found there, falls back to the `user_saved_routes` collection
- Loads route data (coordinates, GeoJSON, POIs, lines, photos) from the appropriate collection
- Handles the different data structures between the two collections
- Constructs a GeoJSON structure from the coordinates if needed
- Returns a unified route object that matches the expected structure for the presentation components

### 2. Route Presentation Component

The `RoutePresentation.js` component has been updated to:

- Load routes exclusively from Firebase using the `getPublicRoute` function
- Display appropriate error messages if the route is not found or if there's an error
- Process and display the route data in the same way as before

### 3. Data Structure Transformation

The implementation handles the transformation between Firebase's document-based structure and the GeoJSON structure expected by the map components:

- Coordinates stored as `{lng, lat}` objects in Firebase are converted to `[lng, lat]` arrays for GeoJSON
- The route document structure is transformed into a format compatible with the existing components
- POIs, lines, and photos are loaded and attached to the route object

### 4. Security Rules

Firebase security rules have been configured to allow:
- Public read access to route data in the `user_saved_routes` collection where `isPublic` is set to `true`
- Read access to subcollections of public routes
- Write access only for authenticated users

The security rules were simplified to ensure reliable access to public route data while maintaining basic security for write operations.

## Firebase Collection and Field Structure

The implementation uses the following Firebase structure:

```
user_saved_routes/{routeId}:
  - userId: string (ID of the user who saved the route)
  - name: string (User-provided name for the route)
  - description: string (Optional description)
  - createdAt: timestamp
  - updatedAt: timestamp
  - statistics: object (Distance, elevation gain/loss, etc.)
    - totalDistance: number
    - totalAscent: number
    - unpavedPercentage: number
  - routeType: string (Optional, "Single" or "Bikepacking")
  - headerSettings: object (Optional, header customization settings)
  - isPublic: boolean (Whether the route is publicly accessible)
  - tags: array (Optional tags for organization)
  - thumbnailUrl: string (URL to the static map thumbnail)
  - thumbnailPublicId: string (Cloudinary public ID for the thumbnail)
  - countries: array (Countries the route passes through)
  - states: array (States/regions the route passes through)
  - lgas: array (Local government areas the route passes through)
  - isLoop: boolean (Whether the route is a loop)

user_saved_routes/{routeId}/data/routes:
  - data: array of objects (Route metadata)
    [
      {
        routeId: string (Unique identifier for the route),
        name: string (Name of the route),
        gpxFileName: string (Original filename),
        statistics: object (Distance, elevation gain/loss, etc.),
        color: string (Route color),
        addedAt: string (ISO date string)
      },
      ...
    ]

user_saved_routes/{routeId}/routes/{routeId}/data/coords:
  - data: array of objects (Coordinate data)
    [
      {
        lng: number (Longitude),
        lat: number (Latitude),
        elevation: number (Optional, elevation in meters)
      },
      ...
    ]
```

## Files Modified

1. `src/services/firebasePublicRouteService.js` - Updated to handle fetching route details from Firebase
2. `src/features/presentation/components/RoutePresentation/RoutePresentation.js` - Updated to load routes from Firebase
3. `src/components/FirebaseRouteTest.jsx` - Created to test Firebase route loading
4. `src/App.jsx` - Updated to include a route for the test component
5. `docs/FIREBASE_SECURITY_RULES_UPDATE.md` - Created to document security rules changes

## Testing

You can test the Firebase route details implementation by:

1. Navigating to `/test-firebase-route/{routeId}` to view the test component
2. Navigating to `/route/{routeId}` or `/preview/route/{routeId}` to view the actual presentation

The direct route at `/route/{routeId}` has been added to support existing links and maintain backward compatibility with the previous URL structure.

## Known Issues

1. **Map Overview Data:** There may be 404 errors when trying to fetch map overview data. This is because the map overview data structure in Firebase differs from the expected structure in the application. This will be addressed in a future update.

2. **Missing Statistics:** Some routes may have incomplete statistics data, which can cause errors in components that expect specific statistics fields. The code should be updated to handle missing statistics gracefully.

## Future Improvements

1. **Caching**:
   - Implement caching of frequently accessed routes to reduce Firestore reads

2. **Offline Support**:
   - Leverage Firestore's offline capabilities to allow the application to work offline

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement lazy loading of route data to improve initial load time
   - Only load the necessary data for the current view

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Improve error handling and recovery mechanisms for missing or incomplete data
   - Provide more detailed error messages to users

5. **Analytics**:
   - Add analytics to track route views and interactions

6. **Map Overview Support**:
   - Update the map overview loader to work with the Firebase data structure
   - Add support for storing and retrieving map overview data in Firebase
