# Migration Log

## AI Assistant Notes (2025-01-25)
Analyzing migration from lutruwita2 to lutruwita2-next:

Key Components to Migrate:
1. GPX Processing System
   - Current: Monolithic structure in src/services
   - Target: Feature-based module under features/gpx/
   - Addition: Mapbox Map Matching API integration

2. Surface Detection
   - Current: Basic surface type assignment
   - Target: Enhanced with Mapbox data
   - Integration: Map Matching API for accurate surface detection

3. Server Architecture
   - Current: Next.js routes
   - Target: Separate Express server for processing
   - Purpose: Handle heavy GPX operations

Migration Plan:
1. Phase 1: Server Setup (Current)
   - Express server infrastructure
   - Basic endpoints
   - File upload handling

2. Phase 2: GPX Processing
   - Port existing processor
   - Integrate Map Matching API
   - Implement SSE progress updates

3. Phase 3: Surface Detection
   - Port current logic
   - Enhance with Mapbox data
   - Improve accuracy

4. Phase 4: Frontend Integration
   - Next.js routes for API
   - React components
   - State management

## 2025-01-25
- Server Architecture Changes:
  - Split into separate Express and Next.js servers
  - Express backend on port 3001 for GPX/surfaces processing
  - Next.js frontend on port 3000
  - Improved separation of concerns


# Migration Log

## 2025-01-25
- Fixed TypeScript module resolution issues:
  - Updated tsconfig.server.json with proper module resolution settings
  - Added TypeScript paths configuration for server middleware
  - Removed manual file extension changes that were causing loops

- Server verification and health checks:
  - Implemented server health check endpoint at /api/health
  - Confirmed active lutruwita2-next server running on port 3000
  - Verified GPX upload endpoints:
    * /api/gpx/upload - File upload endpoint
    * /api/gpx/progress - SSE progress updates
    * /api/gpx/status - Upload status checks
  - Enhanced GPX upload functionality:
    - Fixed map readiness state in MapView.tsx
    - Improved upload UI with better visual feedback:
      * Added loading state during processing
      * Enhanced error feedback with clear messages
      * Improved drag and drop interactions
      * Added smooth transitions and animations
    - Implemented proper Server-Sent Events (SSE):
      * Added progress tracking during file processing
      * Improved connection management
      * Added proper cleanup on completion/error
    - Enhanced type safety:
      * Fixed type definitions in gpxService.ts
      * Added proper error handling types
      * Improved state management types
    - Improved error handling:
      * Added clear error messages
      * Implemented proper error state management
      * Added error recovery flows

## 2025-01-25 (continued)
- DigitalOcean droplet setup initiated:
  * Created Ubuntu 22.04 LTS droplet with Node.js 20.x
  * Configured 2GB RAM / 1 vCPU instance
  * Added SSH key for secure access
  * Currently troubleshooting SSH connectivity:
    - Droplet is pingable but SSH not working
    - Local SSH key confirmed working (successful GitHub auth)
    - Investigating port 22 status and firewall configuration
    - Next steps:
      * Verify DigitalOcean firewall settings
      * Check SSH service status on droplet
      * Verify SSH key was properly added to droplet
      * Attempt DigitalOcean web console access if SSH continues to fail
  - Server deployment progress:
    * Successfully created PM2 ecosystem configuration
    * Established SSH access to droplet
    * Created basic environment variables file
    * Remaining tasks:
      - Configure production database connection
      - Set up firewall rules for port 3000
      - Start application with PM2
