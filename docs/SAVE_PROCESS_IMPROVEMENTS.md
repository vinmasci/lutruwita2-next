# Save Process Improvements

## Problem

The current saving process in creation mode can take up to 10-15 minutes to save a file, which creates a poor user experience and increases the risk of data loss if the application crashes or the user navigates away before the save completes.

Additionally, we identified an issue where the commit button was not appearing for GPX uploads, making it difficult to save route changes.

## Solution

We've implemented a progressive saving system with the following features:

1. **Unified Change Tracking**: The system now tracks which photos and route elements have been modified since the last save
2. **Visual Indicators**: Photos with unsaved changes are highlighted with an amber/orange pulsing effect and appear above other UI elements
3. **Color-Coded Commit Button**: A floating button appears when there are unsaved changes, with colors indicating the volume of changes:
   - Green: < 20 changes (quick save)
   - Yellow: 20-50 changes (moderate save time)
   - Red: 50+ changes (potentially long save time)
4. **Progressive Uploads**: When committing changes, only modified photos and route elements are uploaded, not the entire dataset
5. **Progress Indicator**: A progress bar shows upload status during the commit process
6. **GPX Upload Fix**: Fixed an issue where the commit button wasn't appearing for GPX uploads by explicitly marking routes as changed when a GPX file is uploaded

## Implementation Details

### 1. Context Changes

#### PhotoContext Changes

The `PhotoContext` has been enhanced to track changes to photos:

- Added a `changedPhotos` Set to track which photos have been modified
- Added `trackPhotoChange` function to mark a photo as changed
- Added `clearPhotoChanges` function to clear the change tracking after a successful save
- Added `getChangedPhotos` function to retrieve all photos with pending changes
- Modified existing functions (`addPhoto`, `deletePhoto`, `updatePhoto`, `updatePhotoPosition`) to track changes

#### RouteContext Integration

The existing `changedSections` tracking in `RouteContext` has been integrated with the photo change tracking:

- The system now tracks changes to route elements (routes, mapState, description, metadata, mapOverview)
- The commit button shows the total number of changes (photos + route elements)
- When committing changes, both photos and route elements are saved

#### GPX Upload Improvements

We identified and fixed an issue where the commit button wasn't appearing for GPX uploads:

- Added explicit route change tracking when a GPX file is uploaded
- Added code to mark routes as changed when they're loaded
- Added a fallback mechanism that forces route changes to be tracked if routes exist but no changes are detected
- Added debug logging to help diagnose change tracking issues

##### Additional GPX Upload Fix (April 2025)

We identified and fixed a remaining issue with the commit button not appearing for GPX uploads:

1. **React Hook Error**: Fixed an issue in `MapView.js` where the `usePhotoService` hook was being called inside the `handleCommitChanges` function, which is not allowed in React. We moved the hook call to the top level of the component:
   ```javascript
   // Get photo service at component level
   const photoService = usePhotoService();
   ```

2. **Improved Change Detection**: Updated the `getTotalChangeCount` function to use the `changedSectionsRef` directly instead of relying on the state variable, ensuring we're always working with the most up-to-date changes:
   ```javascript
   // Use the ref directly to get the most up-to-date changes
   const currentChangedSections = changedSectionsRef.current || {};
   ```

3. **Exposed Reference for Debugging**: Modified the `RouteContext.js` file to expose the `changedSectionsRef` directly, allowing components to access the most up-to-date changes even if state updates haven't fully propagated.

### 2. Visual Indicators

The `PhotoMarker` component now shows a visual indicator for photos with unsaved changes:

- Added CSS classes for unsaved changes state
- Added amber/orange pulsing effect to highlight photos that need to be saved
- Updated the marker to check if the photo has unsaved changes
- Increased z-index for unsaved photos to ensure they appear above other UI elements

### 3. Commit Changes Button

Added a `CommitChangesButton` component that:

- Appears when there are unsaved changes (photos or route elements)
- Shows the total number of pending changes
- Changes color based on the total number of changes:
  - Green for fewer than 20 changes
  - Yellow for 20-50 changes
  - Red for more than 50 changes
- Displays a progress indicator during upload
- Triggers the save process when clicked

### 4. MapView Integration

The `MapView` component has been updated to:

- Import both `usePhotoContext` and `useRouteContext` hooks to access change tracking
- Add state variables for tracking upload progress
- Add the `getTotalChangeCount` function to calculate the total number of changes
- Add the `handleCommitChanges` function to process both photo and route uploads
- Add the `CommitChangesButton` to the UI

## Benefits

1. **Faster Saves**: By only uploading changed photos and route elements, the save process is much faster
2. **Better User Experience**: Users can see which photos have unsaved changes and the total number of changes
3. **Reduced Data Loss Risk**: More frequent, smaller saves reduce the risk of losing work
4. **Progress Visibility**: Users can see the upload progress, providing better feedback
5. **Improved Performance**: The application remains responsive during saves
6. **Unified Workflow**: Photos and route changes are saved together in a single operation
7. **Reliable GPX Saving**: The commit button now reliably appears when GPX files are uploaded

### 5. Commit Button Save Dialog Integration (April 2025)

We've further improved the save process by integrating the commit button with the save dialog:

1. **Consistent UI Flow**: Modified the commit button to open the same save dialog used elsewhere in the application
2. **Real-time Progress Feedback**: Enhanced the save dialog to show accurate progress information during uploads
3. **Improved Data Validation**: Ensured that all required metadata (name, type, visibility) is properly set before saving
4. **Maintained Incremental Saving**: Preserved the progressive saving system while improving the user interface
