# POI Investigation

## Issue
Place POIs are not showing up on the map when loaded.

## Debug Steps

1. Checked PlacePOILayer.tsx logs:
   - `poiCount: 3` - We have 3 POIs in state
   - `placePois: 3` - All 3 are place POIs
   - `zoom: 10.185051946264947` - Above zoom threshold
   - `places: 2` - We have 2 places

2. Checked POI filtering:
   - POIs are being filtered correctly by type
   - POIs are being grouped by location correctly
   - No issues found in POI context or types

3. Checked CSS:
   - Found mismatch in CSS classes
   - Code was using `place-poi-marker` but CSS had `.poi-marker`
   - Updated marker classes to match CSS

4. Checked Font Awesome:
   - Icons are using Font Awesome classes (e.g. `fa-solid fa-traffic-cone`)
   - Need to verify Font Awesome is loaded in index.html

## Current Status
- POIs exist in state
- POIs are being filtered and grouped correctly
- Markers are being created with correct coordinates
- CSS classes have been fixed
- Need to verify Font Awesome is loaded

## Next Steps
1. Check if Font Awesome is loaded in index.html
2. If not loaded, add Font Awesome CDN
3. Verify icons appear after adding Font Awesome
