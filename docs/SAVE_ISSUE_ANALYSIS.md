# Save Functionality Issue Analysis

## Problem Identified
Two issues have been found with the save operation:

1. Initially: `PayloadTooLargeError` (HTTP 500) when attempting to save route data
2. Currently: `404 Not Found` error when trying to access the save endpoint

## Error Flow
1. Frontend successfully:
   - Prepares route data
   - Gets Auth0 token
   - Makes API call to `http://localhost:8080/api/save`

2. Server Error (Latest):
   ```
   Cannot POST /api/save
   ```

## Root Causes
1. First Issue (Resolved):
   - Request body exceeded Express's default payload size limit
   - Fixed by increasing the limit to 50mb

2. Current Issue:
   - The API endpoint `/api/save` is not being properly registered
   - Possible mismatch between frontend API URL and backend route configuration
   - Route might be registered as `/api/routes/save` instead of `/api/save`

## Required Fix
1. First Fix (Completed):
   - Updated server configuration to increase payload limits
   - Added body parser configuration with 50mb limit

2. Next Fix Required:
   - Verify route registration in backend
   - Check if the API endpoint in routeService.ts matches the backend route configuration
   - Ensure the route is properly mounted in server.ts
   - Update either frontend URL or backend route to match

## Additional Observations
1. Auth0 integration is working correctly (token is being sent)
2. Frontend validation is passing
3. Request is properly formatted
4. No issues with CORS or authentication
5. Server is running but route is not found

## Next Steps
1. Implement the body parser size increase
2. Consider implementing payload size optimization:
   - Compress route data
   - Limit unnecessary map style information
   - Consider chunked uploads for large datasets
