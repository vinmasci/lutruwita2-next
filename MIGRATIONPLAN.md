### Critical Missing Components
1. **GPX Processing Service**
   - Need to implement server/src/services/gpx/gpx.processing.ts
   - Requires @xmldom/xmldom for GPX parsing
   - Need Mapbox token for map matching

2. **Type Definitions**
   - Need to implement shared types between client and server
   - Required for GPX data structures
   - Surface type enums and interfaces

3. **Environment Setup**
   - Need to add Mapbox token to server/.env
   - Validate environment variables on startup

4. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Need to set up Jest/Vitest
   - Add test fixtures for GPX files
   - Implement integration tests
