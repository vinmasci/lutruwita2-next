# GPX Implementation Status

## Important Context
We have an existing server implementation that:
- Lives in the `server/` directory
- Handles complex GPX processing
- Includes surface detection
- Uses Express server on port 3001
- Has map matching capabilities

We're currently bypassing this server temporarily to:
1. Get basic GPX functionality working
2. Simplify the implementation
3. Test core features
4. Keep the server code for later use

The server code remains in place but unused while we implement client-side processing first.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CURRENT UPLOAD BOX LOCATION
The file upload box in the sidebar is controlled by these files:

1. Main Sidebar Component:
```
src/features/map/components/Sidebar/Sidebar.tsx
```

2. Upload Box Implementation:
```
src/features/map/components/Sidebar/SidebarListItems.tsx  <-- Contains the Upload box item
```

3. Actual Upload Logic:
```
src/features/gpx/components/Uploader/Uploader.tsx  <-- Now uses client-side processing
src/features/gpx/hooks/useClientGpxProcessing.ts  <-- Handles client-side file processing
src/features/gpx/utils/gpxParser.ts              <-- Converts GPX to GeoJSON
```

## Phase 1: ‚úÖ Client-Side Implementation (COMPLETED)
Successfully implemented:
- Client-side GPX to GeoJSON conversion
- Direct map display
- Removed server dependency
- Functional upload box in sidebar
- All validation points passed
- All error handling in place

## Phase 2: üöß Map Matching Implementation (IN PROGRESS)

### Current Implementation Status

#### ‚úÖ Completed
- Added Mapbox access token from environment
- Created `src/features/gpx/services/mapMatchingService.ts`
- Implemented point batching (100 points per request)
- Modified `gpxParser.ts` to handle matched tracks
- Implemented automatic map matching without UI controls
- Added error handling for failed matches

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
1. Point Skipping:
   - Some points in the track are being skipped during matching
   - Results in long straight lines between matched segments
   - Need to investigate if this is due to batch size or confidence thresholds

2. Route Display:
   - Currently showing both original and matched routes
   - Need to update to only show matched route
   - Remove original route display to avoid confusion

#### üîÑ Next Steps
1. Fix point skipping issues:
   - Investigate optimal batch sizes
   - Consider adjusting radius parameters
   - Add point interpolation for large gaps

2. Update route display:
   - Remove original route display
   - Only show matched route
   - Consider adding toggle if comparison needed

3. Improve error handling:
   - Better handling of no-match cases
   - Smooth transitions between batches
   - Handle off-road sections better

### Map Matching Service Implementation

```typescript
// src/features/gpx/services/mapMatchingService.ts
interface MatchingOptions {
  confidenceThreshold?: number;
  radiusMultiplier?: number;
}

export const matchTrackToRoads = async (
  points: [number, number][],
  options: MatchingOptions = {}
) => {
  const { confidenceThreshold = 0.8, radiusMultiplier = 2 } = options;
  
  // Batch points (Mapbox limit: 100 points per request)
  const batches = chunkArray(points, 100);
  
  // Process each batch
  const matchedBatches = await Promise.all(
    batches.map(batch => matchBatch(batch, confidenceThreshold, radiusMultiplier))
  );

  // Combine results
  return combineBatches(matchedBatches);
};
```

### Common Issues Being Addressed
1. Point skipping causing unrealistic straight lines
2. Duplicate route display (original + matched)
3. Batch transition smoothness
4. Off-road section handling
5. Complex intersection matching

## Future Phase 3: Surface Detection
Once map matching is working correctly:
- Add surface type detection
- Integrate with Mapbox data
- Enhance track visualization
- Re-enable server features if needed
