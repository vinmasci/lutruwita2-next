# GPX Implementation Status

## Important Context
We have an existing server implementation that:
- Lives in the `server/` directory
- Handles complex GPX processing
- Includes surface detection
- Uses Express server on port 3001
- Has map matching capabilities

We're currently bypassing this server temporarily to:
1. Get basic GPX functionality working
2. Simplify the implementation
3. Test core features
4. Keep the server code for later use

The server code remains in place but unused while we implement client-side processing first.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CURRENT UPLOAD BOX LOCATION
The file upload box in the sidebar is controlled by these files:

1. Main Sidebar Component:
```
src/features/map/components/Sidebar/Sidebar.tsx
```

2. Upload Box Implementation:
```
src/features/map/components/Sidebar/SidebarListItems.tsx  <-- Contains the Upload box item
```

3. Actual Upload Logic:
```
src/features/gpx/components/Uploader/Uploader.tsx  <-- Now uses client-side processing
src/features/gpx/hooks/useClientGpxProcessing.ts  <-- Handles client-side file processing
src/features/gpx/utils/gpxParser.ts              <-- Converts GPX to GeoJSON
```

## Phase 1: ‚úÖ Client-Side Implementation (COMPLETED)
Successfully implemented:
- Client-side GPX to GeoJSON conversion
- Direct map display
- Removed server dependency
- Functional upload box in sidebar
- All validation points passed
- All error handling in place

## Phase 2: ‚úÖ Map Matching Implementation (COMPLETED)

### Current Implementation Status

#### ‚úÖ Completed
- Added Mapbox access token from environment
- Created `src/features/gpx/services/mapMatchingService.ts`
- Implemented point batching (100 points per request)
- Modified `gpxParser.ts` to handle matched tracks
- Implemented automatic map matching without UI controls
- Added error handling for failed matches
- Fixed route display and point skipping issues
- Implemented clean route visualization

#### üéØ Improvements Made
1. Route Display:
   - Simplified to a single route layer
   - Added white border (8px) for better visibility
   - Implemented red line (#ee5253, 6px) for main route
   - Removed individual point markers
   - Removed duplicate route display

2. Map Matching Optimization:
   - Switched to 'driving' profile for better road matching
   - Lowered confidence threshold (0.6) to accept more matches
   - Increased radius multiplier (3) for better parallel road handling
   - Improved point interpolation (5 points, 20m threshold)
   - Added overview=full parameter for complete route coverage

### Map Matching Service Implementation

```typescript
// src/features/gpx/services/mapMatchingService.ts
interface MatchingOptions {
  confidenceThreshold?: number;
  radiusMultiplier?: number;
  maxGapDistance?: number;
  interpolationPoints?: number;
}

export const matchTrackToRoads = async (
  points: [number, number][],
  options: MatchingOptions = {}
) => {
  const {
    confidenceThreshold = 0.6,
    radiusMultiplier = 3,
    maxGapDistance = 0.0002,
    interpolationPoints = 5
  } = options;
  
  // Batch points (Mapbox limit: 100 points per request)
  const batches = chunkArray(points, 100);
  
  // Process each batch
  const matchedBatches = await Promise.all(
    batches.map(batch => matchBatch(batch, confidenceThreshold, radiusMultiplier))
  );

  // Combine results with interpolation
  return combineBatches(matchedBatches, {
    maxGapDistance,
    interpolationPoints
  });
};
```

### Resolved Issues
1. ‚úÖ Point skipping fixed through:
   - Optimized confidence thresholds
   - Improved radius parameters
   - Enhanced point interpolation

2. ‚úÖ Route display improved:
   - Single route layer with clean styling
   - No more duplicate routes
   - Consistent visualization

3. ‚úÖ Point visibility resolved:
   - Removed individual point markers
   - Clean, continuous route line
   - Proper road snapping

## Future Phase 3: Surface Detection
Once map matching is working correctly:
- Add surface type detection
- Integrate with Mapbox data
- Enhance track visualization
- Re-enable server features if needed
