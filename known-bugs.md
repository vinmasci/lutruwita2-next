# Known Bugs

## Creation Mode
1. Need to be able to re-update the poi places when reloading a map (the poi places just adds a new layer of poi places)
2. Line animation not working with fresh routes
   - 2a. Line animation working for all routes with loaded routes
3. Route order
4. Saving - need to introduce saving as we go
5. When downloading gpx files, the elevation data is not downloading with them!
6. In creation mode, it appears to be showing the selected route but then you can't see the other routes.. it should bring the active layer to the front
7. When I reload the route and then change the order, its saves the whole file again and in one instance it looks like its stopped loading the unpaved surface layer?
8. POI Drawer needs to be moved up one to fill the top of the drawer, the drawer needs to be more scrollable
9. Draggable POIS blinking
10. Draggable POIS not saving now or cache not clearing or something? Can't seem to remove them and save either.

## Layering
Need to fix layering:
- HIGHEST: route tabs
- poi places
- pois
- photo markers
- flags
- map tracer
- POIS into modals

## Presentation Mode
1. When loading a route, there seems to be a loop at the front that blinks the map a few times..
2. When loading a route, the active route isnt always layered at the front like it should be
3. Elevation icon should hide the flags
